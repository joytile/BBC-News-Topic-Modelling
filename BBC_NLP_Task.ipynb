The Texan-born singer approached the producers of the programme with theme tune The Ballad of Jed Clampett for the pilot which was screened in 1962. The show, which told the story of a poor man striking oil and moving to Beverly Hills, ran until 1971.\\n\\nScoggins' daugher Jane Kelly Misel said that her father never tired of the song and would sing it at least once a day. \\\"He'd sing it at birthdays and anniversaries and variety shows. He never stopped performing it,\\\" she said. When a film version of The Beverly Hillbillies was made in 1993, Scoggins came out of retirement to perform the theme tune. Scoggins sang the lyrics while bluegrass stars Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs played guitar and banjo.\",\n          \"Blair says mayor should apologise\\n\\nTony Blair has urged London mayor Ken Livingstone to apologise for his \\\"Nazi\\\" comment to a Jewish reporter.\\n\\nLabour's Mr Livingstone, who says he is \\\"standing by\\\" his remarks, had accused an Evening Standard journalist of being like a \\\"concentration camp guard\\\". Mr Blair told Five's Wright Stuff show: \\\"Let's just apologise and move on.\\\" Mr Livingstone has said the remarks may have been offensive but were not racist, and said he would not apologise even if the prime minister asked.\\n\\nMr Blair, who was instrumental in returning Mr Livingstone to the Labour Party, insisted on Wednesday it was time for the London mayor to say sorry.\\n\\n\\\"A lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time, but in the circumstances, and to the journalist because he was a Jewish journalist, yes, he should apologise,\\\" he said. \\\"Let's just apologise and move on - that's the sensible thing.\\\" Tory leader Michael Howard, asked about Mr Livingstone's remark by reporters, said it was important for politicians to be mindful about the language they use. \\\"It's particularly important that as we get close to the election that politicians talk with civility and courtesy about issues that we all face,\\\" he said. \\\"I think it's a matter of sadness that we are not seeing that from the Labour Party. We had what Ken Livingstone said, we had what Alastair Campbell has said and we have what others have said. I think that's a matter of great regret.\\\"\\n\\nThe row blew up after Mr Livingstone was approached by Evening Standard reporter Oliver Finegold following a party marking the 20th anniversary of former Culture Secretary Chris Smith coming out as Britain's first gay MP. On tape, Mr Livingstone, who once worked as a freelance restaurant critic on the paper, is heard asking Mr Finegold if he is a \\\"German war criminal\\\".\\n\\nMr Finegold replies: \\\"No, I'm Jewish, I wasn't a German war criminal. I'm quite offended by that.\\\" The mayor then says: \\\"Ah right, well you might be, but actually you are like a concentration camp guard, you are just doing it because you are paid to, aren't you?\\\" At his weekly press conference on Tuesday, Mr Livingstone said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise. \\\"If you think they are racist, I think you are wrong,\\\" he told reporters. The dispute comes as an inspection team from the International Olympic committee began a four-day tour to assess London's bid for the 2012 Games. An official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the British Jews, demanding an investigation by the Standards Board of England. It has the power to suspend or bar Mr Livingstone from public office.\",\n          \"TV future in the hands of viewers\\n\\nWith home theatre systems, plasma high-definition TVs, and digital video recorders moving into the living room, the way people watch TV will be radically different in five years' time.\\n\\nThat is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes. With the US leading the trend, programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks, through cable, satellite, telecoms companies, and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices.\\n\\nOne of the most talked-about technologies of CES has been digital and personal video recorders (DVR and PVR). These set-top boxes, like the US's TiVo and the UK's Sky+ system, allow people to record, store, play, pause and forward wind TV programmes when they want.\\n\\nEssentially, the technology allows for much more personalised TV. They are also being built-in to high-definition TV sets, which are big business in Japan and the US, but slower to take off in Europe because of the lack of high-definition programming. Not only can people forward wind through adverts, they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules, putting together their own a-la-carte entertainment. But some US networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as \\\"brand identity\\\" and viewer loyalty to channels. Although the US leads in this technology at the moment, it is also a concern that is being raised in Europe, particularly with the growing uptake of services like Sky+. \\\"What happens here today, we will see in nine months to a years' time in the UK,\\\" Adam Hume, the BBC Broadcast's futurologist told the BBC News website. For the likes of the BBC, there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet. It is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial UK broadcasters, but brand loyalty is important for everyone. \\\"We will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands,\\\" said Tim Hanlon, from brand communications firm Starcom MediaVest. \\\"The reality is that with broadband connections, anybody can be the producer of content.\\\" He added: \\\"The challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice.\\\"\\n\\nWhat this means, said Stacey Jolna, senior vice president of TV Guide TV group, is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for TV viewers. It means that networks, in US terms, or channels could take a leaf out of Google's book and be the search engine of the future, instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch. This kind of channel model might work for the younger iPod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them. But it might not suit everyone, the panel recognised. Older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting. They perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands, Mr Hanlon suggested. \\\"On the other end, you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already - everything is possible and available to them,\\\" said Mr Hanlon. \\\"Ultimately, the consumer will tell the market they want.\\\"\\n\\nOf the 50,000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at CES, many of them are about enhancing the TV-watching experience. High-definition TV sets are everywhere and many new models of LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) TVs have been launched with DVR capability built into them, instead of being external boxes. One such example launched at the show is Humax's 26-inch LCD TV with an 80-hour TiVo DVR and DVD recorder. One of the US's biggest satellite TV companies, DirectTV, has even launched its own branded DVR at the show with 100-hours of recording capability, instant replay, and a search function. The set can pause and rewind TV for up to 90 hours. And Microsoft chief Bill Gates announced in his pre-show keynote speech a partnership with TiVo, called TiVoToGo, which means people can play recorded programmes on Windows PCs and mobile devices. All these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want, when they want.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"sport\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"business\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The Texan-born singer approached the producers of the programme with theme tune The Ballad of Jed Clampett for the pilot which was screened in 1962. The show, which told the story of a poor man striking oil and moving to Beverly Hills, ran until 1971.\\n\\nScoggins' daugher Jane Kelly Misel said that her father never tired of the song and would sing it at least once a day. \\\"He'd sing it at birthdays and anniversaries and variety shows. He never stopped performing it,\\\" she said. When a film version of The Beverly Hillbillies was made in 1993, Scoggins came out of retirement to perform the theme tune. Scoggins sang the lyrics while bluegrass stars Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs played guitar and banjo.\",\n          \"Blair says mayor should apologise\\n\\nTony Blair has urged London mayor Ken Livingstone to apologise for his \\\"Nazi\\\" comment to a Jewish reporter.\\n\\nLabour's Mr Livingstone, who says he is \\\"standing by\\\" his remarks, had accused an Evening Standard journalist of being like a \\\"concentration camp guard\\\". Mr Blair told Five's Wright Stuff show: \\\"Let's just apologise and move on.\\\" Mr Livingstone has said the remarks may have been offensive but were not racist, and said he would not apologise even if the prime minister asked.\\n\\nMr Blair, who was instrumental in returning Mr Livingstone to the Labour Party, insisted on Wednesday it was time for the London mayor to say sorry.\\n\\n\\\"A lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time, but in the circumstances, and to the journalist because he was a Jewish journalist, yes, he should apologise,\\\" he said. \\\"Let's just apologise and move on - that's the sensible thing.\\\" Tory leader Michael Howard, asked about Mr Livingstone's remark by reporters, said it was important for politicians to be mindful about the language they use. \\\"It's particularly important that as we get close to the election that politicians talk with civility and courtesy about issues that we all face,\\\" he said. \\\"I think it's a matter of sadness that we are not seeing that from the Labour Party. We had what Ken Livingstone said, we had what Alastair Campbell has said and we have what others have said. I think that's a matter of great regret.\\\"\\n\\nThe row blew up after Mr Livingstone was approached by Evening Standard reporter Oliver Finegold following a party marking the 20th anniversary of former Culture Secretary Chris Smith coming out as Britain's first gay MP. On tape, Mr Livingstone, who once worked as a freelance restaurant critic on the paper, is heard asking Mr Finegold if he is a \\\"German war criminal\\\".\\n\\nMr Finegold replies: \\\"No, I'm Jewish, I wasn't a German war criminal. I'm quite offended by that.\\\" The mayor then says: \\\"Ah right, well you might be, but actually you are like a concentration camp guard, you are just doing it because you are paid to, aren't you?\\\" At his weekly press conference on Tuesday, Mr Livingstone said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise. \\\"If you think they are racist, I think you are wrong,\\\" he told reporters. The dispute comes as an inspection team from the International Olympic committee began a four-day tour to assess London's bid for the 2012 Games. An official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the British Jews, demanding an investigation by the Standards Board of England. It has the power to suspend or bar Mr Livingstone from public office.\",\n          \"TV future in the hands of viewers\\n\\nWith home theatre systems, plasma high-definition TVs, and digital video recorders moving into the living room, the way people watch TV will be radically different in five years' time.\\n\\nThat is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes. With the US leading the trend, programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks, through cable, satellite, telecoms companies, and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices.\\n\\nOne of the most talked-about technologies of CES has been digital and personal video recorders (DVR and PVR). These set-top boxes, like the US's TiVo and the UK's Sky+ system, allow people to record, store, play, pause and forward wind TV programmes when they want.\\n\\nEssentially, the technology allows for much more personalised TV. They are also being built-in to high-definition TV sets, which are big business in Japan and the US, but slower to take off in Europe because of the lack of high-definition programming. Not only can people forward wind through adverts, they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules, putting together their own a-la-carte entertainment. But some US networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as \\\"brand identity\\\" and viewer loyalty to channels. Although the US leads in this technology at the moment, it is also a concern that is being raised in Europe, particularly with the growing uptake of services like Sky+. \\\"What happens here today, we will see in nine months to a years' time in the UK,\\\" Adam Hume, the BBC Broadcast's futurologist told the BBC News website. For the likes of the BBC, there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet. It is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial UK broadcasters, but brand loyalty is important for everyone. \\\"We will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands,\\\" said Tim Hanlon, from brand communications firm Starcom MediaVest. \\\"The reality is that with broadband connections, anybody can be the producer of content.\\\" He added: \\\"The challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice.\\\"\\n\\nWhat this means, said Stacey Jolna, senior vice president of TV Guide TV group, is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for TV viewers. It means that networks, in US terms, or channels could take a leaf out of Google's book and be the search engine of the future, instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch. This kind of channel model might work for the younger iPod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them. But it might not suit everyone, the panel recognised. Older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting. They perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands, Mr Hanlon suggested. \\\"On the other end, you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already - everything is possible and available to them,\\\" said Mr Hanlon. \\\"Ultimately, the consumer will tell the market they want.\\\"\\n\\nOf the 50,000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at CES, many of them are about enhancing the TV-watching experience. High-definition TV sets are everywhere and many new models of LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) TVs have been launched with DVR capability built into them, instead of being external boxes. One such example launched at the show is Humax's 26-inch LCD TV with an 80-hour TiVo DVR and DVD recorder. One of the US's biggest satellite TV companies, DirectTV, has even launched its own branded DVR at the show with 100-hours of recording capability, instant replay, and a search function. The set can pause and rewind TV for up to 90 hours. And Microsoft chief Bill Gates announced in his pre-show keynote speech a partnership with TiVo, called TiVoToGo, which means people can play recorded programmes on Windows PCs and mobile devices. All these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want, when they want.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in London, has also said it is interested in bidding for LSE. Euronext is due to hold talks with LSE this week and it is reported to be ready to raise \\u00a31.4bn to fund a bid. Euronext chief Jean-Francois Theodore is scheduled to meet his LSE counterpart Clara Furse on Friday. Deutsche Boerse chief Werner Seifert is meeting Ms Furse on Thursday, in the third meeting between the two exchanges since the bid approach in December.\\n\\nThe LSE rejected Deutsche Boerse's proposed \\u00a31.3bn offer in December, saying it undervalued the business.\\n\\nBut it agreed to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a \\\"significantly-improved proposal\\\" would be in the interests of LSE's shareholders and customers. In the meantime, Euronext, which combines the Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with the LSE. In a statement on Thursday, Euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but added that: \\\"There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made.\\\" A deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange.\\n\\nAccording to the FT, in its latest meeting Deutsche Boerse will adopt a charm offensive to woo the London exchange. The newspaper said the German suitor will offer to manage a combined cash and equities market out of London and let Ms Furse take the helm. Other reports this week said the Deutsche Boerse might even consider selling its Luxembourg-based Clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions. Its ownership of Clearstream was seen as the main stumbling block to a London-Frankfurt merger. LSE shareholders feared a Deutsche Boerse takeover would force them to use Clearstream, making it difficult for them to negotiate for lower transaction fees.\",\n          \"German jobless rate at new record\\n\\nMore than 5.2 million Germans were out of work in February, new figures show.\\n\\nThe figure of 5.216 million people, or 12.6% of the working-age population, is the highest jobless rate in Europe's biggest economy since the 1930s. The news comes as the head of Germany's panel of government economic advisers predicted growth would again stagnate. Speaking on German TV, Bert Ruerup said the panel's earlier forecast of 1.4% was too optimistic and warned growth would be just 1% in 2005.\\n\\nThe German government is trying to tackle the stubbornly-high levels of joblessness with a range of labour market reforms. At their centre is the \\\"Hartz-IV\\\" programme introduced in January to shake up welfare benefits and push people back into work - even if some of the jobs are heavily subsidised. The latest unemployment figures look set to increase the pressure on the government. Widely leaked to the German newspapers a day in advance, they produced screaming headlines criticising Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrat-Green Party administration. Mr Schroeder had originally come into office promising to halve unemployment.\\n\\nStill, some measures suggest the picture is not quite so bleak. The soaring official unemployment figure follows a change in the methodology which pushed up the jobless rate by more than 500,000 in January. Adjusted for seasonal changes, the overall unemployment rate is 4.875 million people or 11.7%, up 0.3 percentage points from the previous month. Using the most internationally-accepted methodology of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Germany had 3.97 million people out of work in January. And ILO-based figures also suggest that 14,000 new net jobs were created that month, taking the number of people employed to 38.9 million. The ILO defines an unemployed person as someone who in the previous four weeks had actively looked for work they could take up immediately.\",\n          \"Telegraph newspapers axe 90 jobs\\n\\nThe Daily and Sunday Telegraph newspapers are axing 90 journalist jobs - 17% of their editorial staff.\\n\\nThe Telegraph Group says the cuts are needed to fund an \\u00a3150m investment in new printing facilities. Journalists at the firm met on Friday afternoon to discuss how to react to the surprise announcement. The cuts come against a background of fierce competition for readers and sluggish advertising revenues amid competition from online advertising. The National Union of Journalists has called on the management to recall the notice of redundancy by midday on Monday or face a strike ballot.\\n\\nPearson's Financial Times said last week it was offering voluntary redundancy to about 30 reporters.\\n\\nThe National Union of Journalists said it stood strongly behind the journalists and did not rule out a strike. \\\"Managers have torn up agreed procedures and kicked staff in the teeth by sacking people to pay for printing facilities,\\\" said Jeremy Dear, NUJ General Secretary. NUJ official Barry Fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the 90-day consultation period required for companies planning more than 10 redundancies. \\\"They have shown a complete disregard for the consultative rights of our members,\\\" said Mr Fitzpatrick, who added that the company now planned to observe the consultation procedures. The two Telegraph titles currently employ 521 journalists.\\n\\nSome broadsheet newspapers - especially those which have not moved to a tabloid format - have suffered circulation declines, which are hitting revenues. The Telegraph has announced no plans to go tabloid although both The Independent and The Times have seen circulation rise since shrinking in size.\\n\\nThe Guardian is hedging its bets, planning a larger tabloid format like those popular in continental Europe. The Telegraph Group was bought by the Barclay twins - Frederick and David - last year, having previously been owned by Lord Conrad Black's Hollinger International. The brothers are currently mulling the sale of another of their businesses, retailer Littlewoods.\\n\\nTelegraph executive Murdoch MacLennan said the two newspapers would add eight colour pages in the coming months.\\n\\n\\\"Journalists are the lifeblood of any newspaper, and maintaining the quality of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph for our readers is vital,\\\" he said. \\\"However, action to improve our production capability and secure our titles against the competition is also vital.\\\" Many newspapers are investing in new printing machinery that enables them to print more colour pages, or in some cases, have colour on every page. They are hoping that by boosting colour it will make their publications more attractive to advertisers and readers alike. In recent months News Corp's News International unit, which publishes The Sun and the News of the World, the Guardian Media Group, Trinity Mirror and the Daily Mail & General Trust have all announced substantial investments in new printing plants.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"preprocessed_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 503,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"deutsche boerse set woo lse  boss deutsche boerse london stock exchange meet amid talk takeover bid lse raise 15bn 29bn  month german exchange table 530 pencepershare offer lse value 13bn parisbased euronext owner liffe london interested bid lse euronext due hold talk lse week report ready raise 14bn fund bid euronext chief jeanfrancois theodore schedule meet lse counterpart clara furse friday deutsche boerse chief werner seifert meet ms furse thursday third meeting two exchange bid approach december  lse reject deutsche boerses propose 13bn offer december undervalue business  agree leave door open talk find significantlyimprove proposal interest lses shareholder customer euronext combine paris amsterdam lisbon stock exchange talk lse statement thursday euronext offer solely cash add assurance stage offer deal bidder create big stock market operator europe second big world york stock exchange  accord ft meeting deutsche boerse adopt charm offensive woo london exchange newspaper german suitor offer manage combine cash equity market london ms furse take helm report week deutsche boerse consider sell luxembourgbased clearstream unit   clearing house process security transaction ownership clearstream see main stumbling block londonfrankfurt merger lse shareholder fear deutsche boerse takeover force clearstream difficult negotiate low transaction fee\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 8,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 30,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 32,\n        \"samples\": [\n          25\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Writing in the Financial Times, Mr Schroeder also said heads of government should have a greater say in reforms. Changes to the pact are due to be agreed at an economic summit in March.\\n\\nThe current EU rules limit the size of a eurozone country's deficit to 3% of GDP. Countries which exceed the threshold are liable to heavy fines by the European Commission, although several countries, including Germany, have breached the rules consistently since 2002 without facing punishment. The European Commission acknowledged last month that it would not impose sanctions on countries who break the rules.\\n\\nMr Schroeder - a staunch supporter of the pact when it was set up in the 1990s - said exemptions were now needed to take into account the cost of domestic reform programmes and changing economic conditions. \\\"The stability pact will work better if intervention by European institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions,\\\" he wrote. \\\"Only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the EU.\\\"\\n\\nDeficits should be allowed to rise above 3%, Mr Schroeder argued, if countries meet several \\\"mandatory criteria\\\". These include governments which are adopting costly structural reforms, countries which are suffering economic stagnation and nations which are shouldering \\\"special economic burdens\\\". The proposed changes would make it harder for the European Commission to launch infringement action against any state which breaches the pact's rules. Mr Schroeder's intervention comes ahead of a meeting of the 12 Eurozone finance ministers on Monday to discuss the pact. The issue will also be discussed at Tuesday's Ecofin meeting of the finance ministers of all 25 EU members. Mr Schroeder also called for heads of government to play a larger role in shaping reforms to the pact. A number of EU finance ministers are believed to favour only limited changes to the eurozone's rules.\",\n          \"EU ministers to mull jet fuel tax\\n\\nEuropean Union finance ministers are meeting on Thursday in Brussels, where they are to discuss a controversial jet fuel tax.\\n\\nA levy on jet fuel has been suggested as a way to raise funds to finance aid for the world's poorest nations. Airlines and aviation bodies have reacted strongly against the plans, saying they would hurt companies at a time when earnings are under pressure. The EU said a tax would only be passed after full consultation with airlines. It was keen to point out earlier this week that any new tax on jet fuel should not hurt the \\\"competitiveness of the airlines\\\". Ministers will also be discussing reforms to regulations governing European public spending.\\n\\nGlobal leaders have focused attention on poverty reduction and development at recent meetings of the G7 Group and World Economic Forum. The world's richest countries have said they want to boost the amount of aid they give to 0.7% of their annual gross national income by 2015. Many EU ministers are thought to support the plan to tax jet fuel - tabled by France and Germany following the recent G7 meeting. At present, the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in EU member states.\",\n          \"US in EU tariff chaos trade row\\n\\nThe US has asked the World Trade Organisation to investigate European Union customs tariffs, which it says are inconsistent and hamper trade.\\n\\nThe EU's own institutions have noted the uneven way EU customs rules are applied but failed to act, the US Trade Representative's Office said. Small and mid-sized US firms were worst-hit, it added. The EU expanded from 15 to 25 member states in May. The US said it filed the complaint after talks failed to find a solution.\\n\\nThe move came in the same week that the US and EU stepped back from confrontation in a tense dispute over aircraft subsidies to European manufacturer Airbus and US firm Boeing. New EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson said on Tuesday that the two sides had agreed to reopen talks in the aircraft subsidies row, which led to tit-for-tat WTO filings in last autumn.\\n\\nExplaining why it has asked the WTO to set up a dispute settlement panel on customs barriers, the US Trade Representative's Office said that it wants to tackle the issue \\\"early in the EU's process of dealing with the problems of enlargement\\\". Ten countries, mostly in Eastern Europe, joined the EU in May. The US said its trade with the 25 EU member countries was worth $155.2bn (\\u00a382.8bn) in 2003. \\\"Although the EU is a customs union, there is no single EU customs administration,\\\" a statement issued on behalf of Robert Zoellick, US Trade Representative, said. Lack of uniformity, coupled with lack of procedures for prompt EU-wide review can hinder US exports, especially for small to mid-sized businesses\\\", An EU spokesman in Washington dismissed the US complaint. \\\"We think the US case is very weak. They haven't come up with any evidence that US companies are being harmed,\\\" said Anthony Gooch. It could take several months for the WTO's dispute settlement panel to report its findings.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"preprocessed_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 21,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"germany call eu reform  german chancellor gerhard schroeder call radical reform eus stability pact grant country flexibility budget deficit  schroeder exist fiscal rule loosen allow country run deficit current 3 limit meet certain criterion write financial times schroeder head government great reform change pact due agree economic summit march  current eu rule limit size eurozone countrys deficit 3 gdp countries exceed threshold liable heavy fine european commission country include germany breach rule consistently 2002 face punishment european commission acknowledge month impose sanction country break rule  schroeder   staunch supporter pact set 1990   exemption need take account cost domestic reform programme change economic condition stability pact work intervention european institution budgetary sovereignty national parliament permit limit condition write competence respect member state willing align policy consistently economic goal eu  deficit allow rise 3 schroeder argue country meet mandatory criterion include government adopt costly structural reform country suffer economic stagnation nation shoulder special economic burden propose change hard european commission launch infringement action against state breach pact rule schroeders intervention ahead meeting 12 eurozone finance minister monday discuss pact issue discuss tuesdays ecofin meeting finance minister 25 eu member schroeder call head government play large role shape reform pact number eu finance minister believe favour limited change eurozone rule\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 5,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in London, has also said it is interested in bidding for LSE. Euronext is due to hold talks with LSE this week and it is reported to be ready to raise \\u00a31.4bn to fund a bid. Euronext chief Jean-Francois Theodore is scheduled to meet his LSE counterpart Clara Furse on Friday. Deutsche Boerse chief Werner Seifert is meeting Ms Furse on Thursday, in the third meeting between the two exchanges since the bid approach in December.\\n\\nThe LSE rejected Deutsche Boerse's proposed \\u00a31.3bn offer in December, saying it undervalued the business.\\n\\nBut it agreed to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a \\\"significantly-improved proposal\\\" would be in the interests of LSE's shareholders and customers. In the meantime, Euronext, which combines the Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with the LSE. In a statement on Thursday, Euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but added that: \\\"There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made.\\\" A deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange.\\n\\nAccording to the FT, in its latest meeting Deutsche Boerse will adopt a charm offensive to woo the London exchange. The newspaper said the German suitor will offer to manage a combined cash and equities market out of London and let Ms Furse take the helm. Other reports this week said the Deutsche Boerse might even consider selling its Luxembourg-based Clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions. Its ownership of Clearstream was seen as the main stumbling block to a London-Frankfurt merger. LSE shareholders feared a Deutsche Boerse takeover would force them to use Clearstream, making it difficult for them to negotiate for lower transaction fees.\",\n          \"German jobless rate at new record\\n\\nMore than 5.2 million Germans were out of work in February, new figures show.\\n\\nThe figure of 5.216 million people, or 12.6% of the working-age population, is the highest jobless rate in Europe's biggest economy since the 1930s. The news comes as the head of Germany's panel of government economic advisers predicted growth would again stagnate. Speaking on German TV, Bert Ruerup said the panel's earlier forecast of 1.4% was too optimistic and warned growth would be just 1% in 2005.\\n\\nThe German government is trying to tackle the stubbornly-high levels of joblessness with a range of labour market reforms. At their centre is the \\\"Hartz-IV\\\" programme introduced in January to shake up welfare benefits and push people back into work - even if some of the jobs are heavily subsidised. The latest unemployment figures look set to increase the pressure on the government. Widely leaked to the German newspapers a day in advance, they produced screaming headlines criticising Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrat-Green Party administration. Mr Schroeder had originally come into office promising to halve unemployment.\\n\\nStill, some measures suggest the picture is not quite so bleak. The soaring official unemployment figure follows a change in the methodology which pushed up the jobless rate by more than 500,000 in January. Adjusted for seasonal changes, the overall unemployment rate is 4.875 million people or 11.7%, up 0.3 percentage points from the previous month. Using the most internationally-accepted methodology of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Germany had 3.97 million people out of work in January. And ILO-based figures also suggest that 14,000 new net jobs were created that month, taking the number of people employed to 38.9 million. The ILO defines an unemployed person as someone who in the previous four weeks had actively looked for work they could take up immediately.\",\n          \"Telegraph newspapers axe 90 jobs\\n\\nThe Daily and Sunday Telegraph newspapers are axing 90 journalist jobs - 17% of their editorial staff.\\n\\nThe Telegraph Group says the cuts are needed to fund an \\u00a3150m investment in new printing facilities. Journalists at the firm met on Friday afternoon to discuss how to react to the surprise announcement. The cuts come against a background of fierce competition for readers and sluggish advertising revenues amid competition from online advertising. The National Union of Journalists has called on the management to recall the notice of redundancy by midday on Monday or face a strike ballot.\\n\\nPearson's Financial Times said last week it was offering voluntary redundancy to about 30 reporters.\\n\\nThe National Union of Journalists said it stood strongly behind the journalists and did not rule out a strike. \\\"Managers have torn up agreed procedures and kicked staff in the teeth by sacking people to pay for printing facilities,\\\" said Jeremy Dear, NUJ General Secretary. NUJ official Barry Fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the 90-day consultation period required for companies planning more than 10 redundancies. \\\"They have shown a complete disregard for the consultative rights of our members,\\\" said Mr Fitzpatrick, who added that the company now planned to observe the consultation procedures. The two Telegraph titles currently employ 521 journalists.\\n\\nSome broadsheet newspapers - especially those which have not moved to a tabloid format - have suffered circulation declines, which are hitting revenues. The Telegraph has announced no plans to go tabloid although both The Independent and The Times have seen circulation rise since shrinking in size.\\n\\nThe Guardian is hedging its bets, planning a larger tabloid format like those popular in continental Europe. The Telegraph Group was bought by the Barclay twins - Frederick and David - last year, having previously been owned by Lord Conrad Black's Hollinger International. The brothers are currently mulling the sale of another of their businesses, retailer Littlewoods.\\n\\nTelegraph executive Murdoch MacLennan said the two newspapers would add eight colour pages in the coming months.\\n\\n\\\"Journalists are the lifeblood of any newspaper, and maintaining the quality of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph for our readers is vital,\\\" he said. \\\"However, action to improve our production capability and secure our titles against the competition is also vital.\\\" Many newspapers are investing in new printing machinery that enables them to print more colour pages, or in some cases, have colour on every page. They are hoping that by boosting colour it will make their publications more attractive to advertisers and readers alike. In recent months News Corp's News International unit, which publishes The Sun and the News of the World, the Guardian Media Group, Trinity Mirror and the Daily Mail & General Trust have all announced substantial investments in new printing plants.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"preprocessed_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 503,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"deutsche boerse set woo lse  boss deutsche boerse london stock exchange meet amid talk takeover bid lse raise 15bn 29bn  month german exchange table 530 pencepershare offer lse value 13bn parisbased euronext owner liffe london interested bid lse euronext due hold talk lse week report ready raise 14bn fund bid euronext chief jeanfrancois theodore schedule meet lse counterpart clara furse friday deutsche boerse chief werner seifert meet ms furse thursday third meeting two exchange bid approach december  lse reject deutsche boerses propose 13bn offer december undervalue business  agree leave door open talk find significantlyimprove proposal interest lses shareholder customer euronext combine paris amsterdam lisbon stock exchange talk lse statement thursday euronext offer solely cash add assurance stage offer deal bidder create big stock market operator europe second big world york stock exchange  accord ft meeting deutsche boerse adopt charm offensive woo london exchange newspaper german suitor offer manage combine cash equity market london ms furse take helm report week deutsche boerse consider sell luxembourgbased clearstream unit   clearing house process security transaction ownership clearstream see main stumbling block londonfrankfurt merger lse shareholder fear deutsche boerse takeover force clearstream difficult negotiate low transaction fee\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 8,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 30,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 32,\n        \"samples\": [\n          25\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic_reduced\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic_reduced_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

They join British stars Jude Law and Kate Winslet who have been booked for guest roles. The comic and actor said he had drawn up an A-list of stars he wanted and all had agreed to be in it. \\\"We wanted actors who had iconic status but that we could also deconstruct,\\\" Gervais told BBC News.\\n\\n\\\"It's not about the zeitgeist. We wanted people who would still be around in 20 years, not just the winner of Big Brother to take part.\\\" Gervais admitted he was cautious about revealing who would be taking part until they had all signed on the dotted line. But he has met with Stiller and Jackson and they enjoyed the scripts enough to commit to it.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't want to start revealing names until it was all sorted because people just mention people who haven't even been asked. \\\"I have been linked with ridiculous stories recently such as I'm going to be in a remake of 10 taking Dudley Moore's part. I haven't been approached and I wouldn't take it anyway.\\\"\\n\\nHe said Stiller and Jackson would be playing \\\"twisted\\\" versions of themselves in Extras and that the jokes about them \\\"would sail pretty close to the bone\\\". Gervais and his writing partner Stephen Merchant are currently refining the scripts for the six-part series, in which Gervais plays a struggling actor who bitches about the stars. Meanwhile, Gervais is gearing up to promote his cartoon book Flanimals which is released in the US in March, around the same time as NBC begin showing the US version of The Office. The film rights to Flanimals have already been snapped up but Gervais is keen for the project to be taken slowly. \\\"A film will happen over the next three years but I don't want it to be a $50m movie straight away because it is not well enough known and it wouldn't be another Spider-Man or Batman. I would like to do something small on TV with it first.\\\"\",\n          \"Early Elvis recordings go on sale\\n\\nSome of Elvis Presley's earliest recordings - including takes of All Shook Up - are going under the hammer on Sunday at a Los Angeles auction.\\n\\nThe six unedited reel-to-reel tapes - which were owned by the engineer who recorded them - are valued at up to $50,000 (\\u00a329,000). Highlights of the two hour-long collection will get their public debut at Bonhams auction house on Saturday. The RCA tapes date from September 1956 to September 1957. The \\\"pre-masters\\\" include a take of Jailhouse Rock, religious songs, material for his first Christmas album, and banter between Presley, members of his band and engineer Thorne Nogar.\\n\\n\\\"We've had them for a lot of years, and I think the people should enjoy them,\\\" Nogar's son Stephen, 57, said. \\\"And frankly, we could use the money.\\\" Nogar, who died in 1994 aged 72, always used to make two tapes of sessions as a back-up in case RCA producers wanted to make late changes to songs. \\\"He called them his ass-saver tapes,\\\" his son said. The quality is said to be noticeably crisper than that of a new vinyl record. Because the family does not own the copyright to the music, the tapes can only be sold for \\\"personal enjoyment\\\" and they cannot be copied for commercial gain.\",\n          \"Day-Lewis set for Berlin honour\\n\\nActor Daniel Day-Lewis is to be presented with an award for his career in film at the Berlin Film Festival.\\n\\nThe 47-year-old, whose credits include his Oscar-winning performance in My Left Foot, will be presented with the Berlinale Camera award on 15 February. The honour, awarded since 1986, honours figures in cinema that the festival feels \\\"particularly indebted to\\\". Man to Man, a historical epic starring Kristin Scott Thomas, opens the German festival on 10 February. A candid documentary about the life and career of singer George Michael, A Different Story will also be screened at the 10-day event. '\\n\\nDay-Lewis has competed four times at the Berlin Film Festival, with films In The Name Of The Father (1994), The Crucible (1997), The Boxer (1998) and Martin Scorsese's Gangs Of New York (2003). The festival praises him for his \\\"sensational start\\\" with roles in My Beautiful Launderette and costume classic A Room With A View, and a \\\"great number of celebrated roles\\\" in subsequent productions. Japan's oldest film studio will also be honoured along with Day-Lewis. Shochiku film studios, which was founded 110 years ago, will become the first cinematic institution to receive the Berlinale Camera award. Famous Japanese directors including Akira Kurosawa have had films produced at the studio.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"entertainment\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"preprocessed_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 369,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"alister flock gervais sitcom  hollywood actor samuel l jackson ben stiller sign ricky gervais sitcom comedian tell bbc news  see script agree appear episode sitcom extras join british star jude law kate winslet book guest role comic actor draw alist star want agree want actor iconic status deconstruct gervais tell bbc news  zeitgeist want people 20 year just winner big brother take part gervais admit cautious reveal take part sign dotted line meet stiller jackson enjoy script commit  i want start reveal name sort people just mention people ask i link ridiculous story recently i m go remake 10 take dudley moores part i approach i take anyway  stiller jackson play twisted version extras joke sail pretty close bone gervais writing partner stephen merchant currently refine script sixpart series gervais play struggle actor bitch star gervais gear promote cartoon book flanimals release march time nbc show version office film right flanimal snap gervais keen project take slowly film happen three year i want 50 m movie straight away know spiderman batman i something small tv first\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 12,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 14,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Writing in the Financial Times, Mr Schroeder also said heads of government should have a greater say in reforms. Changes to the pact are due to be agreed at an economic summit in March.\\n\\nThe current EU rules limit the size of a eurozone country's deficit to 3% of GDP. Countries which exceed the threshold are liable to heavy fines by the European Commission, although several countries, including Germany, have breached the rules consistently since 2002 without facing punishment. The European Commission acknowledged last month that it would not impose sanctions on countries who break the rules.\\n\\nMr Schroeder - a staunch supporter of the pact when it was set up in the 1990s - said exemptions were now needed to take into account the cost of domestic reform programmes and changing economic conditions. \\\"The stability pact will work better if intervention by European institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions,\\\" he wrote. \\\"Only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the EU.\\\"\\n\\nDeficits should be allowed to rise above 3%, Mr Schroeder argued, if countries meet several \\\"mandatory criteria\\\". These include governments which are adopting costly structural reforms, countries which are suffering economic stagnation and nations which are shouldering \\\"special economic burdens\\\". The proposed changes would make it harder for the European Commission to launch infringement action against any state which breaches the pact's rules. Mr Schroeder's intervention comes ahead of a meeting of the 12 Eurozone finance ministers on Monday to discuss the pact. The issue will also be discussed at Tuesday's Ecofin meeting of the finance ministers of all 25 EU members. Mr Schroeder also called for heads of government to play a larger role in shaping reforms to the pact. A number of EU finance ministers are believed to favour only limited changes to the eurozone's rules.\",\n          \"EU ministers to mull jet fuel tax\\n\\nEuropean Union finance ministers are meeting on Thursday in Brussels, where they are to discuss a controversial jet fuel tax.\\n\\nA levy on jet fuel has been suggested as a way to raise funds to finance aid for the world's poorest nations. Airlines and aviation bodies have reacted strongly against the plans, saying they would hurt companies at a time when earnings are under pressure. The EU said a tax would only be passed after full consultation with airlines. It was keen to point out earlier this week that any new tax on jet fuel should not hurt the \\\"competitiveness of the airlines\\\". Ministers will also be discussing reforms to regulations governing European public spending.\\n\\nGlobal leaders have focused attention on poverty reduction and development at recent meetings of the G7 Group and World Economic Forum. The world's richest countries have said they want to boost the amount of aid they give to 0.7% of their annual gross national income by 2015. Many EU ministers are thought to support the plan to tax jet fuel - tabled by France and Germany following the recent G7 meeting. At present, the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in EU member states.\",\n          \"US in EU tariff chaos trade row\\n\\nThe US has asked the World Trade Organisation to investigate European Union customs tariffs, which it says are inconsistent and hamper trade.\\n\\nThe EU's own institutions have noted the uneven way EU customs rules are applied but failed to act, the US Trade Representative's Office said. Small and mid-sized US firms were worst-hit, it added. The EU expanded from 15 to 25 member states in May. The US said it filed the complaint after talks failed to find a solution.\\n\\nThe move came in the same week that the US and EU stepped back from confrontation in a tense dispute over aircraft subsidies to European manufacturer Airbus and US firm Boeing. New EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson said on Tuesday that the two sides had agreed to reopen talks in the aircraft subsidies row, which led to tit-for-tat WTO filings in last autumn.\\n\\nExplaining why it has asked the WTO to set up a dispute settlement panel on customs barriers, the US Trade Representative's Office said that it wants to tackle the issue \\\"early in the EU's process of dealing with the problems of enlargement\\\". Ten countries, mostly in Eastern Europe, joined the EU in May. The US said its trade with the 25 EU member countries was worth $155.2bn (\\u00a382.8bn) in 2003. \\\"Although the EU is a customs union, there is no single EU customs administration,\\\" a statement issued on behalf of Robert Zoellick, US Trade Representative, said. Lack of uniformity, coupled with lack of procedures for prompt EU-wide review can hinder US exports, especially for small to mid-sized businesses\\\", An EU spokesman in Washington dismissed the US complaint. \\\"We think the US case is very weak. They haven't come up with any evidence that US companies are being harmed,\\\" said Anthony Gooch. It could take several months for the WTO's dispute settlement panel to report its findings.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"preprocessed_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 21,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"germany call eu reform  german chancellor gerhard schroeder call radical reform eus stability pact grant country flexibility budget deficit  schroeder exist fiscal rule loosen allow country run deficit current 3 limit meet certain criterion write financial times schroeder head government great reform change pact due agree economic summit march  current eu rule limit size eurozone countrys deficit 3 gdp countries exceed threshold liable heavy fine european commission country include germany breach rule consistently 2002 face punishment european commission acknowledge month impose sanction country break rule  schroeder   staunch supporter pact set 1990   exemption need take account cost domestic reform programme change economic condition stability pact work intervention european institution budgetary sovereignty national parliament permit limit condition write competence respect member state willing align policy consistently economic goal eu  deficit allow rise 3 schroeder argue country meet mandatory criterion include government adopt costly structural reform country suffer economic stagnation nation shoulder special economic burden propose change hard european commission launch infringement action against state breach pact rule schroeders intervention ahead meeting 12 eurozone finance minister monday discuss pact issue discuss tuesdays ecofin meeting finance minister 25 eu member schroeder call head government play large role shape reform pact number eu finance minister believe favour limited change eurozone rule\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 5,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic_reduced\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"BERTopic(calculate_probabilities=False, ctfidf_model=ClassTfidfTransformer(...), embedding_model=<bertopic.backend._sentencetransformers.SentenceTransformerBackend object at 0x7d182244f890>, hdbscan_model=HDBSCAN(...), language=None, low_memory=False, min_topic_size=5, n_gram_range=(1, 1), nr_topics=7, representation_model=None, seed_topic_list=None, top_n_words=10, umap_model=UMAP(...), vectorizer_model=CountVectorizer(...), verbose=True, zeroshot_min_similarity=0.7, zeroshot_topic_list=None)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic_reduced_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

They join British stars Jude Law and Kate Winslet who have been booked for guest roles. The comic and actor said he had drawn up an A-list of stars he wanted and all had agreed to be in it. \\\"We wanted actors who had iconic status but that we could also deconstruct,\\\" Gervais told BBC News.\\n\\n\\\"It's not about the zeitgeist. We wanted people who would still be around in 20 years, not just the winner of Big Brother to take part.\\\" Gervais admitted he was cautious about revealing who would be taking part until they had all signed on the dotted line. But he has met with Stiller and Jackson and they enjoyed the scripts enough to commit to it.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't want to start revealing names until it was all sorted because people just mention people who haven't even been asked. \\\"I have been linked with ridiculous stories recently such as I'm going to be in a remake of 10 taking Dudley Moore's part. I haven't been approached and I wouldn't take it anyway.\\\"\\n\\nHe said Stiller and Jackson would be playing \\\"twisted\\\" versions of themselves in Extras and that the jokes about them \\\"would sail pretty close to the bone\\\". Gervais and his writing partner Stephen Merchant are currently refining the scripts for the six-part series, in which Gervais plays a struggling actor who bitches about the stars. Meanwhile, Gervais is gearing up to promote his cartoon book Flanimals which is released in the US in March, around the same time as NBC begin showing the US version of The Office. The film rights to Flanimals have already been snapped up but Gervais is keen for the project to be taken slowly. \\\"A film will happen over the next three years but I don't want it to be a $50m movie straight away because it is not well enough known and it wouldn't be another Spider-Man or Batman. I would like to do something small on TV with it first.\\\"\",\n          \"Early Elvis recordings go on sale\\n\\nSome of Elvis Presley's earliest recordings - including takes of All Shook Up - are going under the hammer on Sunday at a Los Angeles auction.\\n\\nThe six unedited reel-to-reel tapes - which were owned by the engineer who recorded them - are valued at up to $50,000 (\\u00a329,000). Highlights of the two hour-long collection will get their public debut at Bonhams auction house on Saturday. The RCA tapes date from September 1956 to September 1957. The \\\"pre-masters\\\" include a take of Jailhouse Rock, religious songs, material for his first Christmas album, and banter between Presley, members of his band and engineer Thorne Nogar.\\n\\n\\\"We've had them for a lot of years, and I think the people should enjoy them,\\\" Nogar's son Stephen, 57, said. \\\"And frankly, we could use the money.\\\" Nogar, who died in 1994 aged 72, always used to make two tapes of sessions as a back-up in case RCA producers wanted to make late changes to songs. \\\"He called them his ass-saver tapes,\\\" his son said. The quality is said to be noticeably crisper than that of a new vinyl record. Because the family does not own the copyright to the music, the tapes can only be sold for \\\"personal enjoyment\\\" and they cannot be copied for commercial gain.\",\n          \"Day-Lewis set for Berlin honour\\n\\nActor Daniel Day-Lewis is to be presented with an award for his career in film at the Berlin Film Festival.\\n\\nThe 47-year-old, whose credits include his Oscar-winning performance in My Left Foot, will be presented with the Berlinale Camera award on 15 February. The honour, awarded since 1986, honours figures in cinema that the festival feels \\\"particularly indebted to\\\". Man to Man, a historical epic starring Kristin Scott Thomas, opens the German festival on 10 February. A candid documentary about the life and career of singer George Michael, A Different Story will also be screened at the 10-day event. '\\n\\nDay-Lewis has competed four times at the Berlin Film Festival, with films In The Name Of The Father (1994), The Crucible (1997), The Boxer (1998) and Martin Scorsese's Gangs Of New York (2003). The festival praises him for his \\\"sensational start\\\" with roles in My Beautiful Launderette and costume classic A Room With A View, and a \\\"great number of celebrated roles\\\" in subsequent productions. Japan's oldest film studio will also be honoured along with Day-Lewis. Shochiku film studios, which was founded 110 years ago, will become the first cinematic institution to receive the Berlinale Camera award. Famous Japanese directors including Akira Kurosawa have had films produced at the studio.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"entertainment\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"preprocessed_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 369,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"alister flock gervais sitcom  hollywood actor samuel l jackson ben stiller sign ricky gervais sitcom comedian tell bbc news  see script agree appear episode sitcom extras join british star jude law kate winslet book guest role comic actor draw alist star want agree want actor iconic status deconstruct gervais tell bbc news  zeitgeist want people 20 year just winner big brother take part gervais admit cautious reveal take part sign dotted line meet stiller jackson enjoy script commit  i want start reveal name sort people just mention people ask i link ridiculous story recently i m go remake 10 take dudley moores part i approach i take anyway  stiller jackson play twisted version extras joke sail pretty close bone gervais writing partner stephen merchant currently refine script sixpart series gervais play struggle actor bitch star gervais gear promote cartoon book flanimals release march time nbc show version office film right flanimal snap gervais keen project take slowly film happen three year i want 50 m movie straight away know spiderman batman i something small tv first\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 12,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 14,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic_reduced\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"BERTopic(calculate_probabilities=False, ctfidf_model=ClassTfidfTransformer(...), embedding_model=<bertopic.backend._sentencetransformers.SentenceTransformerBackend object at 0x7d17f19db810>, hdbscan_model=HDBSCAN(...), language=None, low_memory=False, min_topic_size=5, n_gram_range=(1, 1), nr_topics=7, representation_model=None, seed_topic_list=None, top_n_words=10, umap_model=UMAP(...), vectorizer_model=CountVectorizer(...), verbose=True, zeroshot_min_similarity=0.7, zeroshot_topic_list=None)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic_reduced_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
