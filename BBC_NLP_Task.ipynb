That was 26% more than in December 2003. The records even surpassed the MDA's own predictions, it said. Every day 78 million messages are sent and there are no signs of a slow down. Before December's bumper text record, the previous highest monthly total was in October 2004, when 2.3 billion were sent. Text messaging is set to smash more records in 2005 too, said the MDA, with forecasts suggesting a total of 30 billion for the year.\\n\\nEven though mobiles are becoming increasingly sophisticated with much more multimedia applications, texting is still one of the most useful functions of mobiles. People are using SMS to do much more too. Booking cinema tickets, text voting, and news or sports text alerts are growing popular. Mobile owners have also given the chance to donate to the Disasters Emergency Committee's (DEC) Asian Tsunami fund by texting \\\"Donate\\\" to a simple short code number. Looking further ahead in the year, the MDA's chairman Mike Short, has predicted that more people will go online through their mobiles, estimating 15 billion WAP page impressions. Handsets with GPRS capability - an \\\"always on\\\" net connection - will rise to 75%, while 3G mobile ownership growing to five million by the end of 2005. These third generation mobiles offer a high-speed connection which means more data like video can be received on the phone. Globally, mobile phone sales passed 167 million in the third quarter of 2004, according to a recent report from analysts Gartner. That was 26% more than the previous year. It is predicted that there would be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005.\",\n          \"Weak dollar hits Reuters\\n\\nRevenues at media group Reuters slipped 11% during 2004, mainly due to the weakness of the dollar, the group said.\\n\\nThe company said it was optimistic about growth even as revenues slipped 11% from \\u00a33.24bn ($6.13bn) in 2003 to \\u00a32.89bn in 2004. Reuters beat profit forecasts, posting a 52% rise in profits for the year to \\u00a3198m from the \\u00a3130m seen a year earlier. Reuters also beat its savings target for 2004, delivering \\u00a3234m of cuts. Under its three-year Fast Forward turnaround plan it had aimed to save \\u00a3220m during the 12 months to 31 December.\\n\\nReuters also managed to slow a decline in underlying revenues to 5.4% from 10.2% in 2003 and cut its debt back to \\u00a3160m from \\u00a3610m a year earlier. The news and financial data seller said the year had begun well, adding it expected \\\"further gradual improvement\\\" in the second quarter of the year after good January sales. It added it was planning to deliver a further \\u00a3105m of savings over the coming year - but said it expects to be hit with an \\u00a380m restructuring charge to pay for the cost of moving from Fleet Street to new headquarters in London at Canary Wharf. \\\"Improving customer relationships, more competitive products and continued strong cost discipline position us well for 2005,\\\" chief executive Tom Glocer said, adding the company was beginning \\\"to look beyond recovery to growth\\\".\",\n          \"Yukos unit fetches $9bn at auction\\n\\nA little-known Russian company has bought the main production unit of oil giant Yukos at auction in Moscow.\\n\\nBaikal Finance Group outbid favourite Gazprom, the state-controlled gas monopoly, to buy Yuganskneftegas. Baikal paid 260.75bn roubles ($9.37bn: \\u00a34.8bn) for Yugansk - nowhere near the $27bn Russia says Yukos owes in taxes. Yukos reacted immediately by repeating its view that the auction was illegal in international and Russian law, and said Baikal had bought itself trouble.\\n\\n\\\"The company considers that the victor of today's auction has bought itself a serious $9bn headache,\\\" said Yukos spokesman Alexander Shadrin. He said the company would continue to make \\\"every lawful move\\\" to protect tens of thousands of shareholders in Yukos from \\\"this forcible and illegitimate removal of their property\\\". Meanwhile, Tim Osborne, head of Yukos main shareholders' group Menatep, said that Yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt, and that legal action would be taken, outside Russia, against the auction winners. Reports from Russia say Baikal has paid a deposit of nearly $1.7bn from a Sberbank (Savings Bank) account to the Russian Federal Property Fund, for Yugansk.\\n\\nThe sale came despite a restraining order issued by a US court dealing with the firm's bankruptcy application for Chapter 11 protection. Yukos has always insisted the auction was state-sponsored theft but Russian authorities argued they were imposing the law, trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes. There were originally four registered bidders, and with its close ties to the Kremlin, state-backed gas monopoly Gazprom had been seen as favourite. But just two companies turned up for the auction, Gazprom and the unknown Baikal Finance Group, named after a large freshwater lake in Siberia. And, according to Tass news agency, Gazprom did not make a single bid, leaving the way open for Baikal, which paid above the auction start price of 246.75bn roubles.\\n\\nMystery firm Baikal Finance Group is officially registered in the central Russian region of Tver, but many analysts believe it may be linked to Gazprom. Kaha Kiknavelidze, analyst at Troika Dialog, said: \\\"I think a decision that Yugansk should end up with Gazprom was taken a long time ago. So the main question was how to structure this transaction.\\n\\n\\\"I would not exclude that the structure of the deal has slightly changed and Gazprom now has a partner. \\\"I would also not exclude that Baikal will decline to pay in 14 days, that are given by law, and Gazprom is then recognised as the winner. This would give Gazprom an extra 14 days to accumulate the needed funds. \\\"Another surprise was that the winner paid a significant premium above the starting price.\\\" However, Gazprom has announced it is not linked to Baikal in any way. And Paul Collison, chief analyst at Brunswick UBS, said: \\\"I see no plausible explanation for the theory that Baikal was representing competing interests. \\\"Yugansk will most likely end up with Gazprom but could still end up with the government. There is still potential for surprises.\\\" Yugansk is at the heart of Yukos - pumping close to a million barrels of oil a day. The unit was seized by the government which claims the oil giant owes more than $27bn in taxes and fines. Yukos says those tax demands are exorbitant, and had sought refuge in US courts.\\n\\nThe US bankruptcy court's initial order on Thursday - to temporarily block the sale - in response to Yukos filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, was upheld in a second ruling on Saturday. The protection, if recognised by the Russian authorities, would have allowed Yukos' current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets. Yukos has said the sale amounts to expropriation - punishment for the political ambitions of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky is now in jail, on separate fraud charges. But President Vladimir Putin has described the affair as a crackdown on corruption - and the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says most Russians believe the destruction of Yukos is now inevitable. Hours before the auction lawyers for Menatep, a group through which Mr Khodorkovsky and his associates control Yukos, said they would take legal action in other countries. Menatep lawyers, who were excluded from observing the auction, said they would retaliate by seeking injunctions in foreign courts to impound Russian oil and gas exports.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"business\",\n          \"entertainment\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

That was 26% more than in December 2003. The records even surpassed the MDA's own predictions, it said. Every day 78 million messages are sent and there are no signs of a slow down. Before December's bumper text record, the previous highest monthly total was in October 2004, when 2.3 billion were sent. Text messaging is set to smash more records in 2005 too, said the MDA, with forecasts suggesting a total of 30 billion for the year.\\n\\nEven though mobiles are becoming increasingly sophisticated with much more multimedia applications, texting is still one of the most useful functions of mobiles. People are using SMS to do much more too. Booking cinema tickets, text voting, and news or sports text alerts are growing popular. Mobile owners have also given the chance to donate to the Disasters Emergency Committee's (DEC) Asian Tsunami fund by texting \\\"Donate\\\" to a simple short code number. Looking further ahead in the year, the MDA's chairman Mike Short, has predicted that more people will go online through their mobiles, estimating 15 billion WAP page impressions. Handsets with GPRS capability - an \\\"always on\\\" net connection - will rise to 75%, while 3G mobile ownership growing to five million by the end of 2005. These third generation mobiles offer a high-speed connection which means more data like video can be received on the phone. Globally, mobile phone sales passed 167 million in the third quarter of 2004, according to a recent report from analysts Gartner. That was 26% more than the previous year. It is predicted that there would be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005.\",\n          \"Weak dollar hits Reuters\\n\\nRevenues at media group Reuters slipped 11% during 2004, mainly due to the weakness of the dollar, the group said.\\n\\nThe company said it was optimistic about growth even as revenues slipped 11% from \\u00a33.24bn ($6.13bn) in 2003 to \\u00a32.89bn in 2004. Reuters beat profit forecasts, posting a 52% rise in profits for the year to \\u00a3198m from the \\u00a3130m seen a year earlier. Reuters also beat its savings target for 2004, delivering \\u00a3234m of cuts. Under its three-year Fast Forward turnaround plan it had aimed to save \\u00a3220m during the 12 months to 31 December.\\n\\nReuters also managed to slow a decline in underlying revenues to 5.4% from 10.2% in 2003 and cut its debt back to \\u00a3160m from \\u00a3610m a year earlier. The news and financial data seller said the year had begun well, adding it expected \\\"further gradual improvement\\\" in the second quarter of the year after good January sales. It added it was planning to deliver a further \\u00a3105m of savings over the coming year - but said it expects to be hit with an \\u00a380m restructuring charge to pay for the cost of moving from Fleet Street to new headquarters in London at Canary Wharf. \\\"Improving customer relationships, more competitive products and continued strong cost discipline position us well for 2005,\\\" chief executive Tom Glocer said, adding the company was beginning \\\"to look beyond recovery to growth\\\".\",\n          \"Yukos unit fetches $9bn at auction\\n\\nA little-known Russian company has bought the main production unit of oil giant Yukos at auction in Moscow.\\n\\nBaikal Finance Group outbid favourite Gazprom, the state-controlled gas monopoly, to buy Yuganskneftegas. Baikal paid 260.75bn roubles ($9.37bn: \\u00a34.8bn) for Yugansk - nowhere near the $27bn Russia says Yukos owes in taxes. Yukos reacted immediately by repeating its view that the auction was illegal in international and Russian law, and said Baikal had bought itself trouble.\\n\\n\\\"The company considers that the victor of today's auction has bought itself a serious $9bn headache,\\\" said Yukos spokesman Alexander Shadrin. He said the company would continue to make \\\"every lawful move\\\" to protect tens of thousands of shareholders in Yukos from \\\"this forcible and illegitimate removal of their property\\\". Meanwhile, Tim Osborne, head of Yukos main shareholders' group Menatep, said that Yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt, and that legal action would be taken, outside Russia, against the auction winners. Reports from Russia say Baikal has paid a deposit of nearly $1.7bn from a Sberbank (Savings Bank) account to the Russian Federal Property Fund, for Yugansk.\\n\\nThe sale came despite a restraining order issued by a US court dealing with the firm's bankruptcy application for Chapter 11 protection. Yukos has always insisted the auction was state-sponsored theft but Russian authorities argued they were imposing the law, trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes. There were originally four registered bidders, and with its close ties to the Kremlin, state-backed gas monopoly Gazprom had been seen as favourite. But just two companies turned up for the auction, Gazprom and the unknown Baikal Finance Group, named after a large freshwater lake in Siberia. And, according to Tass news agency, Gazprom did not make a single bid, leaving the way open for Baikal, which paid above the auction start price of 246.75bn roubles.\\n\\nMystery firm Baikal Finance Group is officially registered in the central Russian region of Tver, but many analysts believe it may be linked to Gazprom. Kaha Kiknavelidze, analyst at Troika Dialog, said: \\\"I think a decision that Yugansk should end up with Gazprom was taken a long time ago. So the main question was how to structure this transaction.\\n\\n\\\"I would not exclude that the structure of the deal has slightly changed and Gazprom now has a partner. \\\"I would also not exclude that Baikal will decline to pay in 14 days, that are given by law, and Gazprom is then recognised as the winner. This would give Gazprom an extra 14 days to accumulate the needed funds. \\\"Another surprise was that the winner paid a significant premium above the starting price.\\\" However, Gazprom has announced it is not linked to Baikal in any way. And Paul Collison, chief analyst at Brunswick UBS, said: \\\"I see no plausible explanation for the theory that Baikal was representing competing interests. \\\"Yugansk will most likely end up with Gazprom but could still end up with the government. There is still potential for surprises.\\\" Yugansk is at the heart of Yukos - pumping close to a million barrels of oil a day. The unit was seized by the government which claims the oil giant owes more than $27bn in taxes and fines. Yukos says those tax demands are exorbitant, and had sought refuge in US courts.\\n\\nThe US bankruptcy court's initial order on Thursday - to temporarily block the sale - in response to Yukos filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, was upheld in a second ruling on Saturday. The protection, if recognised by the Russian authorities, would have allowed Yukos' current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets. Yukos has said the sale amounts to expropriation - punishment for the political ambitions of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky is now in jail, on separate fraud charges. But President Vladimir Putin has described the affair as a crackdown on corruption - and the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says most Russians believe the destruction of Yukos is now inevitable. Hours before the auction lawyers for Menatep, a group through which Mr Khodorkovsky and his associates control Yukos, said they would take legal action in other countries. Menatep lawyers, who were excluded from observing the auction, said they would retaliate by seeking injunctions in foreign courts to impound Russian oil and gas exports.\"\n        ],\n

That was 26% more than in December 2003. The records even surpassed the MDA's own predictions, it said. Every day 78 million messages are sent and there are no signs of a slow down. Before December's bumper text record, the previous highest monthly total was in October 2004, when 2.3 billion were sent. Text messaging is set to smash more records in 2005 too, said the MDA, with forecasts suggesting a total of 30 billion for the year.\\n\\nEven though mobiles are becoming increasingly sophisticated with much more multimedia applications, texting is still one of the most useful functions of mobiles. People are using SMS to do much more too. Booking cinema tickets, text voting, and news or sports text alerts are growing popular. Mobile owners have also given the chance to donate to the Disasters Emergency Committee's (DEC) Asian Tsunami fund by texting \\\"Donate\\\" to a simple short code number. Looking further ahead in the year, the MDA's chairman Mike Short, has predicted that more people will go online through their mobiles, estimating 15 billion WAP page impressions. Handsets with GPRS capability - an \\\"always on\\\" net connection - will rise to 75%, while 3G mobile ownership growing to five million by the end of 2005. These third generation mobiles offer a high-speed connection which means more data like video can be received on the phone. Globally, mobile phone sales passed 167 million in the third quarter of 2004, according to a recent report from analysts Gartner. That was 26% more than the previous year. It is predicted that there would be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005.\",\n          \"Weak dollar hits Reuters\\n\\nRevenues at media group Reuters slipped 11% during 2004, mainly due to the weakness of the dollar, the group said.\\n\\nThe company said it was optimistic about growth even as revenues slipped 11% from \\u00a33.24bn ($6.13bn) in 2003 to \\u00a32.89bn in 2004. Reuters beat profit forecasts, posting a 52% rise in profits for the year to \\u00a3198m from the \\u00a3130m seen a year earlier. Reuters also beat its savings target for 2004, delivering \\u00a3234m of cuts. Under its three-year Fast Forward turnaround plan it had aimed to save \\u00a3220m during the 12 months to 31 December.\\n\\nReuters also managed to slow a decline in underlying revenues to 5.4% from 10.2% in 2003 and cut its debt back to \\u00a3160m from \\u00a3610m a year earlier. The news and financial data seller said the year had begun well, adding it expected \\\"further gradual improvement\\\" in the second quarter of the year after good January sales. It added it was planning to deliver a further \\u00a3105m of savings over the coming year - but said it expects to be hit with an \\u00a380m restructuring charge to pay for the cost of moving from Fleet Street to new headquarters in London at Canary Wharf. \\\"Improving customer relationships, more competitive products and continued strong cost discipline position us well for 2005,\\\" chief executive Tom Glocer said, adding the company was beginning \\\"to look beyond recovery to growth\\\".\",\n          \"Yukos unit fetches $9bn at auction\\n\\nA little-known Russian company has bought the main production unit of oil giant Yukos at auction in Moscow.\\n\\nBaikal Finance Group outbid favourite Gazprom, the state-controlled gas monopoly, to buy Yuganskneftegas. Baikal paid 260.75bn roubles ($9.37bn: \\u00a34.8bn) for Yugansk - nowhere near the $27bn Russia says Yukos owes in taxes. Yukos reacted immediately by repeating its view that the auction was illegal in international and Russian law, and said Baikal had bought itself trouble.\\n\\n\\\"The company considers that the victor of today's auction has bought itself a serious $9bn headache,\\\" said Yukos spokesman Alexander Shadrin. He said the company would continue to make \\\"every lawful move\\\" to protect tens of thousands of shareholders in Yukos from \\\"this forcible and illegitimate removal of their property\\\". Meanwhile, Tim Osborne, head of Yukos main shareholders' group Menatep, said that Yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt, and that legal action would be taken, outside Russia, against the auction winners. Reports from Russia say Baikal has paid a deposit of nearly $1.7bn from a Sberbank (Savings Bank) account to the Russian Federal Property Fund, for Yugansk.\\n\\nThe sale came despite a restraining order issued by a US court dealing with the firm's bankruptcy application for Chapter 11 protection. Yukos has always insisted the auction was state-sponsored theft but Russian authorities argued they were imposing the law, trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes. There were originally four registered bidders, and with its close ties to the Kremlin, state-backed gas monopoly Gazprom had been seen as favourite. But just two companies turned up for the auction, Gazprom and the unknown Baikal Finance Group, named after a large freshwater lake in Siberia. And, according to Tass news agency, Gazprom did not make a single bid, leaving the way open for Baikal, which paid above the auction start price of 246.75bn roubles.\\n\\nMystery firm Baikal Finance Group is officially registered in the central Russian region of Tver, but many analysts believe it may be linked to Gazprom. Kaha Kiknavelidze, analyst at Troika Dialog, said: \\\"I think a decision that Yugansk should end up with Gazprom was taken a long time ago. So the main question was how to structure this transaction.\\n\\n\\\"I would not exclude that the structure of the deal has slightly changed and Gazprom now has a partner. \\\"I would also not exclude that Baikal will decline to pay in 14 days, that are given by law, and Gazprom is then recognised as the winner. This would give Gazprom an extra 14 days to accumulate the needed funds. \\\"Another surprise was that the winner paid a significant premium above the starting price.\\\" However, Gazprom has announced it is not linked to Baikal in any way. And Paul Collison, chief analyst at Brunswick UBS, said: \\\"I see no plausible explanation for the theory that Baikal was representing competing interests. \\\"Yugansk will most likely end up with Gazprom but could still end up with the government. There is still potential for surprises.\\\" Yugansk is at the heart of Yukos - pumping close to a million barrels of oil a day. The unit was seized by the government which claims the oil giant owes more than $27bn in taxes and fines. Yukos says those tax demands are exorbitant, and had sought refuge in US courts.\\n\\nThe US bankruptcy court's initial order on Thursday - to temporarily block the sale - in response to Yukos filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, was upheld in a second ruling on Saturday. The protection, if recognised by the Russian authorities, would have allowed Yukos' current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets. Yukos has said the sale amounts to expropriation - punishment for the political ambitions of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky is now in jail, on separate fraud charges. But President Vladimir Putin has described the affair as a crackdown on corruption - and the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says most Russians believe the destruction of Yukos is now inevitable. Hours before the auction lawyers for Menatep, a group through which Mr Khodorkovsky and his associates control Yukos, said they would take legal action in other countries. Menatep lawyers, who were excluded from observing the auction, said they would retaliate by seeking injunctions in foreign courts to impound Russian oil and gas exports.\"\n        ],\n
