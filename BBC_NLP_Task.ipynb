The Texan-born singer approached the producers of the programme with theme tune The Ballad of Jed Clampett for the pilot which was screened in 1962. The show, which told the story of a poor man striking oil and moving to Beverly Hills, ran until 1971.\\n\\nScoggins' daugher Jane Kelly Misel said that her father never tired of the song and would sing it at least once a day. \\\"He'd sing it at birthdays and anniversaries and variety shows. He never stopped performing it,\\\" she said. When a film version of The Beverly Hillbillies was made in 1993, Scoggins came out of retirement to perform the theme tune. Scoggins sang the lyrics while bluegrass stars Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs played guitar and banjo.\",\n          \"Blair says mayor should apologise\\n\\nTony Blair has urged London mayor Ken Livingstone to apologise for his \\\"Nazi\\\" comment to a Jewish reporter.\\n\\nLabour's Mr Livingstone, who says he is \\\"standing by\\\" his remarks, had accused an Evening Standard journalist of being like a \\\"concentration camp guard\\\". Mr Blair told Five's Wright Stuff show: \\\"Let's just apologise and move on.\\\" Mr Livingstone has said the remarks may have been offensive but were not racist, and said he would not apologise even if the prime minister asked.\\n\\nMr Blair, who was instrumental in returning Mr Livingstone to the Labour Party, insisted on Wednesday it was time for the London mayor to say sorry.\\n\\n\\\"A lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time, but in the circumstances, and to the journalist because he was a Jewish journalist, yes, he should apologise,\\\" he said. \\\"Let's just apologise and move on - that's the sensible thing.\\\" Tory leader Michael Howard, asked about Mr Livingstone's remark by reporters, said it was important for politicians to be mindful about the language they use. \\\"It's particularly important that as we get close to the election that politicians talk with civility and courtesy about issues that we all face,\\\" he said. \\\"I think it's a matter of sadness that we are not seeing that from the Labour Party. We had what Ken Livingstone said, we had what Alastair Campbell has said and we have what others have said. I think that's a matter of great regret.\\\"\\n\\nThe row blew up after Mr Livingstone was approached by Evening Standard reporter Oliver Finegold following a party marking the 20th anniversary of former Culture Secretary Chris Smith coming out as Britain's first gay MP. On tape, Mr Livingstone, who once worked as a freelance restaurant critic on the paper, is heard asking Mr Finegold if he is a \\\"German war criminal\\\".\\n\\nMr Finegold replies: \\\"No, I'm Jewish, I wasn't a German war criminal. I'm quite offended by that.\\\" The mayor then says: \\\"Ah right, well you might be, but actually you are like a concentration camp guard, you are just doing it because you are paid to, aren't you?\\\" At his weekly press conference on Tuesday, Mr Livingstone said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise. \\\"If you think they are racist, I think you are wrong,\\\" he told reporters. The dispute comes as an inspection team from the International Olympic committee began a four-day tour to assess London's bid for the 2012 Games. An official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the British Jews, demanding an investigation by the Standards Board of England. It has the power to suspend or bar Mr Livingstone from public office.\",\n          \"TV future in the hands of viewers\\n\\nWith home theatre systems, plasma high-definition TVs, and digital video recorders moving into the living room, the way people watch TV will be radically different in five years' time.\\n\\nThat is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes. With the US leading the trend, programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks, through cable, satellite, telecoms companies, and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices.\\n\\nOne of the most talked-about technologies of CES has been digital and personal video recorders (DVR and PVR). These set-top boxes, like the US's TiVo and the UK's Sky+ system, allow people to record, store, play, pause and forward wind TV programmes when they want.\\n\\nEssentially, the technology allows for much more personalised TV. They are also being built-in to high-definition TV sets, which are big business in Japan and the US, but slower to take off in Europe because of the lack of high-definition programming. Not only can people forward wind through adverts, they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules, putting together their own a-la-carte entertainment. But some US networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as \\\"brand identity\\\" and viewer loyalty to channels. Although the US leads in this technology at the moment, it is also a concern that is being raised in Europe, particularly with the growing uptake of services like Sky+. \\\"What happens here today, we will see in nine months to a years' time in the UK,\\\" Adam Hume, the BBC Broadcast's futurologist told the BBC News website. For the likes of the BBC, there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet. It is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial UK broadcasters, but brand loyalty is important for everyone. \\\"We will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands,\\\" said Tim Hanlon, from brand communications firm Starcom MediaVest. \\\"The reality is that with broadband connections, anybody can be the producer of content.\\\" He added: \\\"The challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice.\\\"\\n\\nWhat this means, said Stacey Jolna, senior vice president of TV Guide TV group, is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for TV viewers. It means that networks, in US terms, or channels could take a leaf out of Google's book and be the search engine of the future, instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch. This kind of channel model might work for the younger iPod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them. But it might not suit everyone, the panel recognised. Older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting. They perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands, Mr Hanlon suggested. \\\"On the other end, you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already - everything is possible and available to them,\\\" said Mr Hanlon. \\\"Ultimately, the consumer will tell the market they want.\\\"\\n\\nOf the 50,000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at CES, many of them are about enhancing the TV-watching experience. High-definition TV sets are everywhere and many new models of LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) TVs have been launched with DVR capability built into them, instead of being external boxes. One such example launched at the show is Humax's 26-inch LCD TV with an 80-hour TiVo DVR and DVD recorder. One of the US's biggest satellite TV companies, DirectTV, has even launched its own branded DVR at the show with 100-hours of recording capability, instant replay, and a search function. The set can pause and rewind TV for up to 90 hours. And Microsoft chief Bill Gates announced in his pre-show keynote speech a partnership with TiVo, called TiVoToGo, which means people can play recorded programmes on Windows PCs and mobile devices. All these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want, when they want.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"sport\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"business\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Paying per track for music is becoming as outmoded as paying per minute for internet access and alternative monthly or yearly subscription models are springing up as a more convenient, and ultimately cheaper way of owning music.\\n\\n\\\"Music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of a dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle; either single tracks or subscriptions services,\\\" said Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit, a UK-based music download service. While iTunes is doing good business with its sales of individual tracks to iPod owners, others are questioning whether the concept of owning music is even valid in the digital age. Napster is due to launch a new rental subscription service - dubbed Napster to Go in the UK in the next few months. The service can be used on players that support Microsoft Windows latest Digital Rights Management technology known as Janus. This includes players made by Samsung, Rio and Creative.\\n\\nCurrently on offer in beta-version in the US, the service costs $15 per month for unlimited downloads. The technology ensures that music downloaded to the player only remains playable while the user subscribes to the service. Users need to update their license on a monthly basis or the tunes will no longer play.\\n\\nThis has outraged some digital music lovers, especially as Napster already offers a cheaper service for downloading music to the PC. Napster claims the higher price is a result of record labels charging more for the to-go service and says it also offers \\\"greater value\\\" for customers. Mr Myers is not convinced a rental model will work for consumers. \\\"We've been offering our unlimited music subscription service for more than three years now and our customers know what they want. Format interoperability, excellent value and the reassurance that music purchased from Wippit is theirs to keep and enjoy on whatever device they choose,\\\" he said. \\\"Who wants to download a track that won't play next month if you decide to unsubscribe to the service or change portable player for an iPod or the latest mobile phone?\\\" Wippit offers a download subscription service for \\u00a34.99 per month or \\u00a350 per year. It has a catalogue of around 60,000 songs.\",\n          \"Hantuchova in Dubai last eight\\n\\nDaniela Hantuchova moved into the quarter-finals of the Dubai Open, after beating Elene Likhotseva of Russia 7-5 6-4, and now faces Serena Williams.\\n\\nAustralian Open champion Williams survived an early scare to beat Russia's Elena Bovina 1-6 6-1 6-4. World number one Lindsay Davenport and Anastasia Myskina also progressed. Davenport defeated China's Jie Zheng 6-2 7-5, while French Open champion Myskina sailed through after her opponent Marion Bartoli retired hurt. American Davenport will now face fellow former Wimbledon champion, Conchita Martinez of Spain, who ousted seventh-seeded Nathalie Dechy of France 6-1 6-2. Myskina will face eighth-seed Patty Schnyder from Switzerland, who defeated China's Li Na 6-3 7-6 (10-8). The other quarter final pits wild card Sania Mirza of India against Jelena Jankovic of Serbia and Montenegro, who both won on Tuesday.\\n\\nBefore her meeting with Martinez, Davenport believes there is some room for improvement in her game. \\\"I started well and finished well, but played some so-so games in the middle,\\\" she said. Williams was also far from content. \\\"I don't know what I was doing there,\\\" she said. \\\"It was really windy and I hadn't played in the wind. All my shots were going out of here.\\\" But Hantuchova is in upbeat mood ahead of her clash with the younger Williams sister, who was handed a first-round bye. \\\"I feel I have an advantage (over Serena) because I have already played two matches on these courts,\\\" she said. \\\"It is a difficult court to play on. Very fast and sometimes you feel you have no control over the ball.\\\"\",\n          \"Virus poses as Christmas e-mail\\n\\nSecurity firms are warning about a Windows virus disguising itself as an electronic Christmas card.\\n\\nThe Zafi.D virus translates the Christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected e-mail. Anti-virus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping the malicious program spread widely online. Anti-virus firm Sophos said that 10% of the e-mail currently on the net was infected with the Zafi virus.\\n\\nLike many other Windows viruses, Zafi-D plunders Microsoft Outlook for e-mail addresses and then uses mail-sending software to despatch itself across the web to new victims. To be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug. The attachment on the e-mail poses as an electronic Christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces.\\n\\nThe virus' subject line says \\\"Merry Christmas\\\" and translates this into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the e-mail address the infected message has been sent to. The message in the body of the e-mail reads: \\\"Happy Holidays\\\" and this too is translated. On infected machines the virus tries to disable anti-virus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the PC to hand over control to the writer of the virus. The virus is thought to have spread most widely in South America, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria and Hungary. The original Zafi virus appeared in April this year. \\\"We have seen these hoaxes for several Christmases already, and personally I prefer traditional pen and paper cards, and we recommend this to all our clients too,\\\" said Mikko Hypponen, who heads F-Secure's anti-virus team.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"business\",\n          \"entertainment\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The Texan-born singer approached the producers of the programme with theme tune The Ballad of Jed Clampett for the pilot which was screened in 1962. The show, which told the story of a poor man striking oil and moving to Beverly Hills, ran until 1971.\\n\\nScoggins' daugher Jane Kelly Misel said that her father never tired of the song and would sing it at least once a day. \\\"He'd sing it at birthdays and anniversaries and variety shows. He never stopped performing it,\\\" she said. When a film version of The Beverly Hillbillies was made in 1993, Scoggins came out of retirement to perform the theme tune. Scoggins sang the lyrics while bluegrass stars Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs played guitar and banjo.\",\n          \"Blair says mayor should apologise\\n\\nTony Blair has urged London mayor Ken Livingstone to apologise for his \\\"Nazi\\\" comment to a Jewish reporter.\\n\\nLabour's Mr Livingstone, who says he is \\\"standing by\\\" his remarks, had accused an Evening Standard journalist of being like a \\\"concentration camp guard\\\". Mr Blair told Five's Wright Stuff show: \\\"Let's just apologise and move on.\\\" Mr Livingstone has said the remarks may have been offensive but were not racist, and said he would not apologise even if the prime minister asked.\\n\\nMr Blair, who was instrumental in returning Mr Livingstone to the Labour Party, insisted on Wednesday it was time for the London mayor to say sorry.\\n\\n\\\"A lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time, but in the circumstances, and to the journalist because he was a Jewish journalist, yes, he should apologise,\\\" he said. \\\"Let's just apologise and move on - that's the sensible thing.\\\" Tory leader Michael Howard, asked about Mr Livingstone's remark by reporters, said it was important for politicians to be mindful about the language they use. \\\"It's particularly important that as we get close to the election that politicians talk with civility and courtesy about issues that we all face,\\\" he said. \\\"I think it's a matter of sadness that we are not seeing that from the Labour Party. We had what Ken Livingstone said, we had what Alastair Campbell has said and we have what others have said. I think that's a matter of great regret.\\\"\\n\\nThe row blew up after Mr Livingstone was approached by Evening Standard reporter Oliver Finegold following a party marking the 20th anniversary of former Culture Secretary Chris Smith coming out as Britain's first gay MP. On tape, Mr Livingstone, who once worked as a freelance restaurant critic on the paper, is heard asking Mr Finegold if he is a \\\"German war criminal\\\".\\n\\nMr Finegold replies: \\\"No, I'm Jewish, I wasn't a German war criminal. I'm quite offended by that.\\\" The mayor then says: \\\"Ah right, well you might be, but actually you are like a concentration camp guard, you are just doing it because you are paid to, aren't you?\\\" At his weekly press conference on Tuesday, Mr Livingstone said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise. \\\"If you think they are racist, I think you are wrong,\\\" he told reporters. The dispute comes as an inspection team from the International Olympic committee began a four-day tour to assess London's bid for the 2012 Games. An official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the British Jews, demanding an investigation by the Standards Board of England. It has the power to suspend or bar Mr Livingstone from public office.\",\n          \"TV future in the hands of viewers\\n\\nWith home theatre systems, plasma high-definition TVs, and digital video recorders moving into the living room, the way people watch TV will be radically different in five years' time.\\n\\nThat is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes. With the US leading the trend, programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks, through cable, satellite, telecoms companies, and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices.\\n\\nOne of the most talked-about technologies of CES has been digital and personal video recorders (DVR and PVR). These set-top boxes, like the US's TiVo and the UK's Sky+ system, allow people to record, store, play, pause and forward wind TV programmes when they want.\\n\\nEssentially, the technology allows for much more personalised TV. They are also being built-in to high-definition TV sets, which are big business in Japan and the US, but slower to take off in Europe because of the lack of high-definition programming. Not only can people forward wind through adverts, they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules, putting together their own a-la-carte entertainment. But some US networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as \\\"brand identity\\\" and viewer loyalty to channels. Although the US leads in this technology at the moment, it is also a concern that is being raised in Europe, particularly with the growing uptake of services like Sky+. \\\"What happens here today, we will see in nine months to a years' time in the UK,\\\" Adam Hume, the BBC Broadcast's futurologist told the BBC News website. For the likes of the BBC, there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet. It is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial UK broadcasters, but brand loyalty is important for everyone. \\\"We will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands,\\\" said Tim Hanlon, from brand communications firm Starcom MediaVest. \\\"The reality is that with broadband connections, anybody can be the producer of content.\\\" He added: \\\"The challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice.\\\"\\n\\nWhat this means, said Stacey Jolna, senior vice president of TV Guide TV group, is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for TV viewers. It means that networks, in US terms, or channels could take a leaf out of Google's book and be the search engine of the future, instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch. This kind of channel model might work for the younger iPod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them. But it might not suit everyone, the panel recognised. Older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting. They perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands, Mr Hanlon suggested. \\\"On the other end, you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already - everything is possible and available to them,\\\" said Mr Hanlon. \\\"Ultimately, the consumer will tell the market they want.\\\"\\n\\nOf the 50,000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at CES, many of them are about enhancing the TV-watching experience. High-definition TV sets are everywhere and many new models of LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) TVs have been launched with DVR capability built into them, instead of being external boxes. One such example launched at the show is Humax's 26-inch LCD TV with an 80-hour TiVo DVR and DVD recorder. One of the US's biggest satellite TV companies, DirectTV, has even launched its own branded DVR at the show with 100-hours of recording capability, instant replay, and a search function. The set can pause and rewind TV for up to 90 hours. And Microsoft chief Bill Gates announced in his pre-show keynote speech a partnership with TiVo, called TiVoToGo, which means people can play recorded programmes on Windows PCs and mobile devices. All these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want, when they want.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

The Texan-born singer approached the producers of the programme with theme tune The Ballad of Jed Clampett for the pilot which was screened in 1962. The show, which told the story of a poor man striking oil and moving to Beverly Hills, ran until 1971.\\n\\nScoggins' daugher Jane Kelly Misel said that her father never tired of the song and would sing it at least once a day. \\\"He'd sing it at birthdays and anniversaries and variety shows. He never stopped performing it,\\\" she said. When a film version of The Beverly Hillbillies was made in 1993, Scoggins came out of retirement to perform the theme tune. Scoggins sang the lyrics while bluegrass stars Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs played guitar and banjo.\",\n          \"Blair says mayor should apologise\\n\\nTony Blair has urged London mayor Ken Livingstone to apologise for his \\\"Nazi\\\" comment to a Jewish reporter.\\n\\nLabour's Mr Livingstone, who says he is \\\"standing by\\\" his remarks, had accused an Evening Standard journalist of being like a \\\"concentration camp guard\\\". Mr Blair told Five's Wright Stuff show: \\\"Let's just apologise and move on.\\\" Mr Livingstone has said the remarks may have been offensive but were not racist, and said he would not apologise even if the prime minister asked.\\n\\nMr Blair, who was instrumental in returning Mr Livingstone to the Labour Party, insisted on Wednesday it was time for the London mayor to say sorry.\\n\\n\\\"A lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time, but in the circumstances, and to the journalist because he was a Jewish journalist, yes, he should apologise,\\\" he said. \\\"Let's just apologise and move on - that's the sensible thing.\\\" Tory leader Michael Howard, asked about Mr Livingstone's remark by reporters, said it was important for politicians to be mindful about the language they use. \\\"It's particularly important that as we get close to the election that politicians talk with civility and courtesy about issues that we all face,\\\" he said. \\\"I think it's a matter of sadness that we are not seeing that from the Labour Party. We had what Ken Livingstone said, we had what Alastair Campbell has said and we have what others have said. I think that's a matter of great regret.\\\"\\n\\nThe row blew up after Mr Livingstone was approached by Evening Standard reporter Oliver Finegold following a party marking the 20th anniversary of former Culture Secretary Chris Smith coming out as Britain's first gay MP. On tape, Mr Livingstone, who once worked as a freelance restaurant critic on the paper, is heard asking Mr Finegold if he is a \\\"German war criminal\\\".\\n\\nMr Finegold replies: \\\"No, I'm Jewish, I wasn't a German war criminal. I'm quite offended by that.\\\" The mayor then says: \\\"Ah right, well you might be, but actually you are like a concentration camp guard, you are just doing it because you are paid to, aren't you?\\\" At his weekly press conference on Tuesday, Mr Livingstone said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise. \\\"If you think they are racist, I think you are wrong,\\\" he told reporters. The dispute comes as an inspection team from the International Olympic committee began a four-day tour to assess London's bid for the 2012 Games. An official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the British Jews, demanding an investigation by the Standards Board of England. It has the power to suspend or bar Mr Livingstone from public office.\",\n          \"TV future in the hands of viewers\\n\\nWith home theatre systems, plasma high-definition TVs, and digital video recorders moving into the living room, the way people watch TV will be radically different in five years' time.\\n\\nThat is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes. With the US leading the trend, programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks, through cable, satellite, telecoms companies, and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices.\\n\\nOne of the most talked-about technologies of CES has been digital and personal video recorders (DVR and PVR). These set-top boxes, like the US's TiVo and the UK's Sky+ system, allow people to record, store, play, pause and forward wind TV programmes when they want.\\n\\nEssentially, the technology allows for much more personalised TV. They are also being built-in to high-definition TV sets, which are big business in Japan and the US, but slower to take off in Europe because of the lack of high-definition programming. Not only can people forward wind through adverts, they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules, putting together their own a-la-carte entertainment. But some US networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as \\\"brand identity\\\" and viewer loyalty to channels. Although the US leads in this technology at the moment, it is also a concern that is being raised in Europe, particularly with the growing uptake of services like Sky+. \\\"What happens here today, we will see in nine months to a years' time in the UK,\\\" Adam Hume, the BBC Broadcast's futurologist told the BBC News website. For the likes of the BBC, there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet. It is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial UK broadcasters, but brand loyalty is important for everyone. \\\"We will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands,\\\" said Tim Hanlon, from brand communications firm Starcom MediaVest. \\\"The reality is that with broadband connections, anybody can be the producer of content.\\\" He added: \\\"The challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice.\\\"\\n\\nWhat this means, said Stacey Jolna, senior vice president of TV Guide TV group, is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for TV viewers. It means that networks, in US terms, or channels could take a leaf out of Google's book and be the search engine of the future, instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch. This kind of channel model might work for the younger iPod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them. But it might not suit everyone, the panel recognised. Older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting. They perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands, Mr Hanlon suggested. \\\"On the other end, you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already - everything is possible and available to them,\\\" said Mr Hanlon. \\\"Ultimately, the consumer will tell the market they want.\\\"\\n\\nOf the 50,000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at CES, many of them are about enhancing the TV-watching experience. High-definition TV sets are everywhere and many new models of LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) TVs have been launched with DVR capability built into them, instead of being external boxes. One such example launched at the show is Humax's 26-inch LCD TV with an 80-hour TiVo DVR and DVD recorder. One of the US's biggest satellite TV companies, DirectTV, has even launched its own branded DVR at the show with 100-hours of recording capability, instant replay, and a search function. The set can pause and rewind TV for up to 90 hours. And Microsoft chief Bill Gates announced in his pre-show keynote speech a partnership with TiVo, called TiVoToGo, which means people can play recorded programmes on Windows PCs and mobile devices. All these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want, when they want.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

Some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions, while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms The EC says the Council of Ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last May but said it would review \\\"all aspects of the directive\\\". The directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect, in other words, \\\"computer implemented invention\\\".\\n\\nIn a letter, EC President Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso told the President of the European Parliament, Josep Borrell, that the Commission \\\"did not intend to refer a new proposal to the Parliament and the Council (of ministers)\\\" as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in May 2004.\\n\\nIf the European Council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the European Parliament. But that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive. Most EU legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the Council of Ministers before it becomes law. French Green MEP Alain Lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the Commission ignored the Parliament's request it would be an \\\"insult\\\" to the assembly. He said that the parliament would then reject the Council's version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted.\\n\\nThis means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its \\\"one-click shopping\\\" service, for example. Critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in Europe. This, they fear, could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US.\",\n          \"Sun offers processing by the hour\\n\\nSun Microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour.\\n\\nSun Grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by Sun. So-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity.\\n\\nThe system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed, said Sun's chief operating officer Jonathan Schwartz. \\\"Why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?\\\" he asked in a webcast launching Sun's quarterly Network Computing event in California. The company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil, gas and financial services industries.\\n\\nSome of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5,000 processors each, Sun said. Mr Schwartz ran a demonstration of the service, showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment. Hundreds of servers were used simultaneously, working on the problem for a few seconds each.\\n\\nAlthough it only took a few seconds, the experiment cost $12 (\\u00a36.30) because it had used up 12 hours' worth of computing power. The Sun Grid relies on Solaris, the operating system owned by Sun. Initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers. It has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in IBM, which argues that its capacity on-demand service is cheaper than that offered by Sun.\",\n          \"Disney backs Sony DVD technology\\n\\nA next generation DVD technology backed by Sony has received a major boost.\\n\\nFilm giant Disney says it will produce its future DVDs using Sony's Blu-ray Disc technology, but has not ruled out a rival format developed by Toshiba. The two competing DVD formats, Blu-ray developed by Sony and others, and Toshiba's HD-DVD, have been courting top film studios for several months. The next generation of DVDs promises very high quality pictures and sound, as well as a lot of data. Both technologies use a blue laser to write information. It has a shorter wavelength so more data can be stored. Disney is the latest studio to announce which technology it is backing in a format battle which mirrors the 1980s Betamax versus VHS war. Sony lost out to JVC in that fight.\\n\\nThe current battle for Hollywood's hearts and minds is a crucial one because high-definition films will bring in billions of revenue and the studios would prefer to use one standard. Last month, Paramount, Universal and Warner Brothers said they were opting for the Toshiba and NEC-backed format, HD-DVD high-definition discs.\\n\\nThose studios currently produce about 45% of DVD content. Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM Studios have already staked their allegiance with the Blu-ray Disc Association, whose members also include technology companies Dell, Samsung and Matsushita. Twentieth Century Fox is still to announce which technology it will be supporting. If Fox decided to go with Blu-ray too, it would mean the format would have a 47% share of DVD content. Disney said its films would be available on the Blu-ray format when DVD players for the standard went on sale on North America and Japan, expected in 2006. Universal is to start producing films on the HD-DVD format in 2005, and Paramount will start releasing titles using the standard in 2006. Toshiba expects sales of HD-DVDs to reach 300bn yen ($2.9bn, \\u00a31.5bn) by 2010.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in London, has also said it is interested in bidding for LSE. Euronext is due to hold talks with LSE this week and it is reported to be ready to raise \\u00a31.4bn to fund a bid. Euronext chief Jean-Francois Theodore is scheduled to meet his LSE counterpart Clara Furse on Friday. Deutsche Boerse chief Werner Seifert is meeting Ms Furse on Thursday, in the third meeting between the two exchanges since the bid approach in December.\\n\\nThe LSE rejected Deutsche Boerse's proposed \\u00a31.3bn offer in December, saying it undervalued the business.\\n\\nBut it agreed to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a \\\"significantly-improved proposal\\\" would be in the interests of LSE's shareholders and customers. In the meantime, Euronext, which combines the Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with the LSE. In a statement on Thursday, Euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but added that: \\\"There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made.\\\" A deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange.\\n\\nAccording to the FT, in its latest meeting Deutsche Boerse will adopt a charm offensive to woo the London exchange. The newspaper said the German suitor will offer to manage a combined cash and equities market out of London and let Ms Furse take the helm. Other reports this week said the Deutsche Boerse might even consider selling its Luxembourg-based Clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions. Its ownership of Clearstream was seen as the main stumbling block to a London-Frankfurt merger. LSE shareholders feared a Deutsche Boerse takeover would force them to use Clearstream, making it difficult for them to negotiate for lower transaction fees.\",\n          \"German jobless rate at new record\\n\\nMore than 5.2 million Germans were out of work in February, new figures show.\\n\\nThe figure of 5.216 million people, or 12.6% of the working-age population, is the highest jobless rate in Europe's biggest economy since the 1930s. The news comes as the head of Germany's panel of government economic advisers predicted growth would again stagnate. Speaking on German TV, Bert Ruerup said the panel's earlier forecast of 1.4% was too optimistic and warned growth would be just 1% in 2005.\\n\\nThe German government is trying to tackle the stubbornly-high levels of joblessness with a range of labour market reforms. At their centre is the \\\"Hartz-IV\\\" programme introduced in January to shake up welfare benefits and push people back into work - even if some of the jobs are heavily subsidised. The latest unemployment figures look set to increase the pressure on the government. Widely leaked to the German newspapers a day in advance, they produced screaming headlines criticising Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrat-Green Party administration. Mr Schroeder had originally come into office promising to halve unemployment.\\n\\nStill, some measures suggest the picture is not quite so bleak. The soaring official unemployment figure follows a change in the methodology which pushed up the jobless rate by more than 500,000 in January. Adjusted for seasonal changes, the overall unemployment rate is 4.875 million people or 11.7%, up 0.3 percentage points from the previous month. Using the most internationally-accepted methodology of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Germany had 3.97 million people out of work in January. And ILO-based figures also suggest that 14,000 new net jobs were created that month, taking the number of people employed to 38.9 million. The ILO defines an unemployed person as someone who in the previous four weeks had actively looked for work they could take up immediately.\",\n          \"Telegraph newspapers axe 90 jobs\\n\\nThe Daily and Sunday Telegraph newspapers are axing 90 journalist jobs - 17% of their editorial staff.\\n\\nThe Telegraph Group says the cuts are needed to fund an \\u00a3150m investment in new printing facilities. Journalists at the firm met on Friday afternoon to discuss how to react to the surprise announcement. The cuts come against a background of fierce competition for readers and sluggish advertising revenues amid competition from online advertising. The National Union of Journalists has called on the management to recall the notice of redundancy by midday on Monday or face a strike ballot.\\n\\nPearson's Financial Times said last week it was offering voluntary redundancy to about 30 reporters.\\n\\nThe National Union of Journalists said it stood strongly behind the journalists and did not rule out a strike. \\\"Managers have torn up agreed procedures and kicked staff in the teeth by sacking people to pay for printing facilities,\\\" said Jeremy Dear, NUJ General Secretary. NUJ official Barry Fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the 90-day consultation period required for companies planning more than 10 redundancies. \\\"They have shown a complete disregard for the consultative rights of our members,\\\" said Mr Fitzpatrick, who added that the company now planned to observe the consultation procedures. The two Telegraph titles currently employ 521 journalists.\\n\\nSome broadsheet newspapers - especially those which have not moved to a tabloid format - have suffered circulation declines, which are hitting revenues. The Telegraph has announced no plans to go tabloid although both The Independent and The Times have seen circulation rise since shrinking in size.\\n\\nThe Guardian is hedging its bets, planning a larger tabloid format like those popular in continental Europe. The Telegraph Group was bought by the Barclay twins - Frederick and David - last year, having previously been owned by Lord Conrad Black's Hollinger International. The brothers are currently mulling the sale of another of their businesses, retailer Littlewoods.\\n\\nTelegraph executive Murdoch MacLennan said the two newspapers would add eight colour pages in the coming months.\\n\\n\\\"Journalists are the lifeblood of any newspaper, and maintaining the quality of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph for our readers is vital,\\\" he said. \\\"However, action to improve our production capability and secure our titles against the competition is also vital.\\\" Many newspapers are investing in new printing machinery that enables them to print more colour pages, or in some cases, have colour on every page. They are hoping that by boosting colour it will make their publications more attractive to advertisers and readers alike. In recent months News Corp's News International unit, which publishes The Sun and the News of the World, the Guardian Media Group, Trinity Mirror and the Daily Mail & General Trust have all announced substantial investments in new printing plants.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"preprocessed_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 503,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"deutsche boerse set woo lse  boss deutsche boerse london stock exchange meet amid talk takeover bid lse raise 15bn 29bn  month german exchange table 530 pencepershare offer lse value 13bn parisbased euronext owner liffe london interested bid lse euronext due hold talk lse week report ready raise 14bn fund bid euronext chief jeanfrancois theodore schedule meet lse counterpart clara furse friday deutsche boerse chief werner seifert meet ms furse thursday third meeting two exchange bid approach december  lse reject deutsche boerses propose 13bn offer december undervalue business  agree leave door open talk find significantlyimprove proposal interest lses shareholder customer euronext combine paris amsterdam lisbon stock exchange talk lse statement thursday euronext offer solely cash add assurance stage offer deal bidder create big stock market operator europe second big world york stock exchange  accord ft meeting deutsche boerse adopt charm offensive woo london exchange newspaper german suitor offer manage combine cash equity market london ms furse take helm report week deutsche boerse consider sell luxembourgbased clearstream unit   clearing house process security transaction ownership clearstream see main stumbling block londonfrankfurt merger lse shareholder fear deutsche boerse takeover force clearstream difficult negotiate low transaction fee\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 8,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 28,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30,\n        \"samples\": [\n          13\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

They join British stars Jude Law and Kate Winslet who have been booked for guest roles. The comic and actor said he had drawn up an A-list of stars he wanted and all had agreed to be in it. \\\"We wanted actors who had iconic status but that we could also deconstruct,\\\" Gervais told BBC News.\\n\\n\\\"It's not about the zeitgeist. We wanted people who would still be around in 20 years, not just the winner of Big Brother to take part.\\\" Gervais admitted he was cautious about revealing who would be taking part until they had all signed on the dotted line. But he has met with Stiller and Jackson and they enjoyed the scripts enough to commit to it.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't want to start revealing names until it was all sorted because people just mention people who haven't even been asked. \\\"I have been linked with ridiculous stories recently such as I'm going to be in a remake of 10 taking Dudley Moore's part. I haven't been approached and I wouldn't take it anyway.\\\"\\n\\nHe said Stiller and Jackson would be playing \\\"twisted\\\" versions of themselves in Extras and that the jokes about them \\\"would sail pretty close to the bone\\\". Gervais and his writing partner Stephen Merchant are currently refining the scripts for the six-part series, in which Gervais plays a struggling actor who bitches about the stars. Meanwhile, Gervais is gearing up to promote his cartoon book Flanimals which is released in the US in March, around the same time as NBC begin showing the US version of The Office. The film rights to Flanimals have already been snapped up but Gervais is keen for the project to be taken slowly. \\\"A film will happen over the next three years but I don't want it to be a $50m movie straight away because it is not well enough known and it wouldn't be another Spider-Man or Batman. I would like to do something small on TV with it first.\\\"\",\n          \"Early Elvis recordings go on sale\\n\\nSome of Elvis Presley's earliest recordings - including takes of All Shook Up - are going under the hammer on Sunday at a Los Angeles auction.\\n\\nThe six unedited reel-to-reel tapes - which were owned by the engineer who recorded them - are valued at up to $50,000 (\\u00a329,000). Highlights of the two hour-long collection will get their public debut at Bonhams auction house on Saturday. The RCA tapes date from September 1956 to September 1957. The \\\"pre-masters\\\" include a take of Jailhouse Rock, religious songs, material for his first Christmas album, and banter between Presley, members of his band and engineer Thorne Nogar.\\n\\n\\\"We've had them for a lot of years, and I think the people should enjoy them,\\\" Nogar's son Stephen, 57, said. \\\"And frankly, we could use the money.\\\" Nogar, who died in 1994 aged 72, always used to make two tapes of sessions as a back-up in case RCA producers wanted to make late changes to songs. \\\"He called them his ass-saver tapes,\\\" his son said. The quality is said to be noticeably crisper than that of a new vinyl record. Because the family does not own the copyright to the music, the tapes can only be sold for \\\"personal enjoyment\\\" and they cannot be copied for commercial gain.\",\n          \"Day-Lewis set for Berlin honour\\n\\nActor Daniel Day-Lewis is to be presented with an award for his career in film at the Berlin Film Festival.\\n\\nThe 47-year-old, whose credits include his Oscar-winning performance in My Left Foot, will be presented with the Berlinale Camera award on 15 February. The honour, awarded since 1986, honours figures in cinema that the festival feels \\\"particularly indebted to\\\". Man to Man, a historical epic starring Kristin Scott Thomas, opens the German festival on 10 February. A candid documentary about the life and career of singer George Michael, A Different Story will also be screened at the 10-day event. '\\n\\nDay-Lewis has competed four times at the Berlin Film Festival, with films In The Name Of The Father (1994), The Crucible (1997), The Boxer (1998) and Martin Scorsese's Gangs Of New York (2003). The festival praises him for his \\\"sensational start\\\" with roles in My Beautiful Launderette and costume classic A Room With A View, and a \\\"great number of celebrated roles\\\" in subsequent productions. Japan's oldest film studio will also be honoured along with Day-Lewis. Shochiku film studios, which was founded 110 years ago, will become the first cinematic institution to receive the Berlinale Camera award. Famous Japanese directors including Akira Kurosawa have had films produced at the studio.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"entertainment\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"preprocessed_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 369,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"alister flock gervais sitcom  hollywood actor samuel l jackson ben stiller sign ricky gervais sitcom comedian tell bbc news  see script agree appear episode sitcom extras join british star jude law kate winslet book guest role comic actor draw alist star want agree want actor iconic status deconstruct gervais tell bbc news  zeitgeist want people 20 year just winner big brother take part gervais admit cautious reveal take part sign dotted line meet stiller jackson enjoy script commit  i want start reveal name sort people just mention people ask i link ridiculous story recently i m go remake 10 take dudley moores part i approach i take anyway  stiller jackson play twisted version extras joke sail pretty close bone gervais writing partner stephen merchant currently refine script sixpart series gervais play struggle actor bitch star gervais gear promote cartoon book flanimals release march time nbc show version office film right flanimal snap gervais keen project take slowly film happen three year i want 50 m movie straight away know spiderman batman i something small tv first\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 9,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Departments for defence, environment and trade, which had all increased file destruction, said they were following rules governing public records. But the Tories want the information commissioner to investigate. The Freedom of Information Act will for the first time give members of the public access to government records previously kept secret for 30 years. But BBC Political Correspondent James Hardy said the prospect of outsiders poking their noses into the inner workings of Whitehall appeared to be causing jitters among the mandarins.\\n\\nLiberal Democrat Alan Beith - who chairs the select committee which monitors the Department of Constitutional Affairs - said if the claims were true, Whitehall was \\\"acting entirely against the spirit of the new Act\\\". \\\"Both the information commissioner and the select committee will have to keep this issue under very close scrutiny.\\\" Fellow Lib Dem Norman Baker said the episode painted an \\\"unflattering picture of the inner workings of government\\\". \\\"It is clear that the government's initial enthusiasm for open government has turned to self-serving cynicism.\\\" Dr Julian Lewis, the Conservative spokesman for the Cabinet Office, said he had discovered a huge acceleration in shredding from a series of parliamentary answers.\\n\\nThe Department of Work and Pensions destroyed nearly 37,000 files last year - up 22,000 on four years ago when the Act was passed. The number of files destroyed by the Ministry of Defence and the departments of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Trade and Industry has also risen dramatically. Dr Lewis has called for an investigation by the information commissioner Richard Thomas. Earlier this week, Mr Thomas said he was looking into Cabinet Office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old. He said he \\\"totally condemned\\\" the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 January.\\n\\nGovernment guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served \\\"no current purpose\\\", Mr Thomas said. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or \\\"the destruction of important records\\\". The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions.\",\n          \"Asylum children to face returns\\n\\nThe UK government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to Albania.\\n\\nThe trial scheme, which could start in weeks, may be extended to apply to children from other countries. Children's charities have reacted with alarm, saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected. But the Home Office says it may be in the children's best interests if it reunites them with their communities.\\n\\nThe pilot, included in the government's five-year immigration plan, aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Albania who have failed in their asylum claims.\\n\\nSince 2002, at least 9,000 under-18s have arrived in the UK to seek asylum without other family members. These children automatically become the responsibility of social services. Up to now, ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18. At least a dozen Albanian-born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return, according to sources, although there is no public confirmation of numbers. Those selected could either be returned to their families, should they be traced, or placed in the care of other Albanian authorities. Separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country.\\n\\nUnder the 1989 Children Act, public bodies have a duty to act in the \\\"best interest\\\" of a child in their care. Laura Brownlees of Save the Children said there were grave concerns, not least because of the well-documented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in Albania.\\n\\n\\\"If children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis,\\\" she said. \\\"We do not think there are structures in place [to receive returning children in Albania]. 'If these decisions are not in the best interests of the child, then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision.\\\" In its five-year immigration plan, announced on Tuesday, the government said it was addressing \\\"the difficult issue\\\" of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children. A spokesman for the Home Office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children \\\"and leave them to rot\\\". \\\"We are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused,\\\" said the spokesman. \\\"We have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it's possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable.\\n\\n\\\"We do not believe that it is right, or in keeping with children's legislation, that children who can return should remain in the UK indefinitely separated from their families and communities.\\\" The spokesman stressed the UK would abide by its international human rights obligations. Only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned, he said. But Andrew Hogg, spokesman for the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies. \\\"From what is so far known, we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account,\\\" said Mr Hogg. \\\"In Albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure. \\\"The Medical Foundation has many serious concerns, including the assessment process for suitability for return, the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare, and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries.\\\" A spokesman for the Albanian embassy in London said it was the first it had heard of a scheme, but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries.\",\n          \"Mallon wades into NE vote battle\\n\\nMiddlesbrough mayor Ray Mallon has been drafted in to boost the Yes campaign as the North East assembly referendum enters its final week.\\n\\nThe former police chief, dubbed Robocop for his zero tolerance style, clashed on Thursday with Sunderland No campaigner Neil Herron. Mr Mallon said an assembly would give local people more of a say over key issues such as transport and crime. But Mr Herron said North East people did not want or need an assembly.\\n\\nThe pair met on the platform at Sunderland station as Mr Mallon toured the region highlighting claimed improvements to transport if the area gets an assembly. But Mr Herron - who gained fame as one of Sunderland's \\\"metric martyrs\\\" and is running his own No campaign alongside the official North East Says No campaign - said he was not convinced by Mr Mallon's arguments. \\\"The reality is that it is not going to deliver,\\\" he said. \\\"Labour has had two-and-a-half years to convince people of this. If you can't sell a deal in that time, it is a bad deal.\\\" On Wednesday, Mr Mallon provoked fury by branding the official No Campaign \\\"two-bit Tories\\\" in a confrontation outside its Durham headquarters. \\\"The campaign is being run by two-bit Conservatives who are not interested in what happens in the North East; they are interested in hitting the Labour party over the head,\\\" he said. Mr Mallon is a late recruit to the Yes campaign after rejecting overtures from No campaigners including, he claims, Tory leader Michael Howard.\\n\\nMost local observers believe the contest is too close to call, although little recent polling has been carried out. Yes campaign chairman John Tomaney said he hoped for a late flurry of votes to boost turnout - something he says will boost their cause. He added: \\\"The government exerts a lot of political power in the North East. The accountability should be in the North East as well.\\\" He also defended the decision to attack the official No campaign's alleged political allegiances. \\\"We felt we had to show what people were behind the No campaign - London Tory spin doctors.\\\" Graham Robb, spokesman for North East Says No, said the Yes campaign's decision to get personal dragged the campaign \\\"into the gutter\\\" and showed they were \\\"rattled\\\". And he hit back at Mr Mallon's claim that an assembly would improve transport links in the region. \\\"It can push paper around but it can not get people moving,\\\" he said. Some 487,939 people had returned their ballot papers by Wednesday - a turnout of 25.7%. The deadline for voting is next Thursday, 4 November.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"preprocessed_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 403,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"whitehall shred increase   tory  civil servant drastically step shredding official document figure compile tories suggest  government department double number document shred ahead freedom information act implementation 1 january departments defence environment trade increase file destruction follow rule govern public record tories want information commissioner investigate freedom information act first time give member public access government record previously keep secret 30 year bbc political correspondent james hardy prospect outsider poke nose inner working whitehall appear cause jitter mandarin  liberal democrat alan beith   chair select committee monitor department constitutional affairs   claim true whitehall act entirely against spirit act information commissioner select committee keep issue close scrutiny fellow lib dem norman baker episode paint unflattering picture inner working government clear government initial enthusiasm open government turn selfserve cynicism dr julian lewis conservative spokesman cabinet office discover huge acceleration shred series parliamentary answer  department work pensions destroy nearly 37000 file year   22000 four year ago act pass number file destroy ministry defence department environment food rural affairs trade industry rise dramatically dr lewis call investigation information commissioner richard thomas week thomas look cabinet office order tell staff delete email three month old totally condemn deletion email prevent disclosure freedom information law force 1 january  government guidance email delete serve current purpose thomas cabinet office spokeswoman move law destruction important record freedom information act cover england wales northern ireland year similar measure bring time scotland provide public right access information hold 100000 public body subject various exemption\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 5,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 19,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 21,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Radcliffe's career took a setback when she failed to complete the Olympic marathon and later dropped out of the Athens 10,000m last August. But the 31-year-old bounced back to win the New York Marathon in November. Radcliffe, however, passed up the chance to go for the \\\"Big City\\\" marathon grand slam. With wins in Chicago, London and New York, only the Boston Marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after London. \\\"Boston is definitely a race I want to do at some point, but London is very special to me,\\\" said Radcliffe. \\\"I don't pick races thinking about things like pressure. I pick the ones in my heart I really want to do. \\\"I love the atmosphere, crowds and course and know it will always be a great quality race. \\\"It is also the 25th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion.\\\"\",\n          \"England 17-18 France\\n\\nEngland suffered an eighth defeat in 11 Tests as scrum-half Dimitri Yachvili booted France to victory at Twickenham.\\n\\nTwo converted tries from Olly Barkley and Josh Lewsey helped the world champions to a 17-6 half-time lead. But Charlie Hodgson and Barkley missed six penalties between them, while Yachvili landed six for France to put the visitors in front. England could have won the game with three minutes left, but Hodgson pushed an easy drop goal opportunity wide. It was a dismal defeat for England, coming hard on the heels of an opening Six Nations loss in Wales. They should have put the game well beyond France's reach, but remarkably remained scoreless for the entire second half. A scrappy opening quarter saw both sides betray the lack of confidence engendered by poor opening displays against Wales and Scotland respectively. Hodgson had an early opportunity to settle English nerves but pushed a straightforward penalty attempt wide. But a probing kick from France centre Damien Traille saw Mark Cueto penalised for holding on to the ball in the tackle, Yachvili giving France the lead with a kick from wide out.\\n\\nFrance twice turned over England ball at the breakdown early on as the home side struggled to generate forward momentum, one Ben Kay charge apart. A spell of tit-for-tat kicking emphasised the caution on both sides, until England refused a possible three points to kick a penalty to the corner, only to botch the subsequent line-out. But England made the breakthrough after 19 minutes, when a faltering move off the back of a scrum led to the opening try. Jamie Noon took a short pass from Barkley and ran a good angle to plough through Yann Delaigue's flimsy tackle before sending his centre partner through to score at the posts.\\n\\nHodgson converted and added a penalty after one of several French infringements on the floor for a 10-3 lead. The fly-half failed to dispense punishment though with a scuffed attempt after France full-back Pepito Elhorga, scragged by Lewsey, threw the ball into touch. Barkley also missed two longer-range efforts as the first half drew to a close, but by then England had scored a second converted try. After a series of phases lock Danny Grewcock ran hard at the French defence and off-loaded out of Sylvain Marconnet's tackle to Lewsey. The industrious wing cut back in on an angle and handed off hooker Sebastien Bruno to sprint over. After a dire opening to the second half, France threw on three forward replacements in an attempt to rectify the situation, wing Jimmy Marlu having already departed injured. Yachvili nibbled away at the lead with a third penalty after 51 minutes.\\n\\nAnd when Lewis Moody was twice penalised - for handling in a ruck and then straying offside - the scrum-half's unerring left boot cut the deficit to two points. Barkley then missed his third long-range effort to increase the tension. And after seeing another attempt drop just short, Yachvili put France ahead with his sixth penalty with 11 minutes left.\\n\\nEngland sent on Ben Cohen and Matt Dawson, and after Barkley's kick saw Christophe Dominici take the ball over his own line, the stage was set for a victory platform. But even after a poor scrummage, Hodgson had the chance to seal victory but pushed his drop-goal attempt wide. England threw everything at the French in the final frantic moments, but the visitors held on for their first win at Twickenham since 1997.\\n\\nJ Robinson (capt); M Cueto, J Noon, O Barkley, J Lewsey; C Hodgson, H Ellis; G Rowntree, S Thompson, P Vickery; D Grewcock, B Kay; J Worsley, L Moody, M Corry.\\n\\nA Titterrell, A Sheridan, S Borthwick, A Hazell, M Dawson, H Paul, B Cohen.\\n\\nP Elhorga; C Dominici, B Liebenberg, D Traille, J Marlu; Y Delaigue, D Yachvili; S Marconnet, S Bruno, N Mas; F Pelous (capt), J Thion, S Betsen, J Bonnaire, S Chabal.\\n\\nW Servat, J Milloud, G Lamboley, Y Nyanga, P Mignoni, F Michalak, J-P Grandclaude.\\n\\nPaddy O'Brien (New Zealand)\",\n          \"Curbishley delight for Johansson\\n\\nCharlton manager Alan Curbishley paid tribute to two-goal striker Jonatan Johansson after beating Norwich.\\n\\nCurbishley said after the 4-0 win: \\\"There was talk about Norwich being interested in the summer but I have a lot of faith in Jonatan. \\\"When there was talk of other clubs I just told him he was going nowhere. \\\"He's part of our squad and he got us a couple of important goals early on.

But what does it do and how does it work?\\n\\nPicture the scene - Wales are camped on the England line in the dying seconds of the Six Nations' opening match. A ball is flung out to winger Shane Williams who crosses to score the winning try for Wales. But the England players are incensed - arguing that the pass was forward and the try should not stand. In the past, sports fans would be left debating the validity of the try for days and weeks to come. But BBC Sport's new tool Piero could end discussions in minutes.\\n\\nPiero, named after the Italian painter and pioneer of perspective Piero della Francesco, creates a virtual stadium in which virtual players can be tracked from almost any angle. Viewers will be able to see precisely how the ball was thrown and by whom, giving a greater depth to the growing wealth of analysis available during sports broadcasts. The technology has been created by BBC Research and Development for BBC Broadcast and BBC Outside Broadcasts. BBC Sport is the first client to start using the system. \\\"In order to keep audiences growing and growing... we need to work closely with people who create technology and innovation to bring sport to life,\\\" said Andrew Thompson, the BBC's head of development, new media and sports news. \\\"We want to appeal to core fans - to give them more analysis, more detail, more definitive answers about key passages of play.\\\" Piero works by taking telemetric data from fixed camera positions and sending that data inside the video signal to a PC which can then render the information into 3D graphics.\\n\\nThe more cameras using Piero, the better the detail possible out the other end when the data is turned into 3D models. \\\"It allows us to tell the story of a passage of play, tracking individual players across the field, looking at tactics,\\\" said Andy Townsend, from BBC Broadcast.\\n\\nAn operator can manipulate the information and provide almost real-time replays of incidents, as well as more in-depth analysis. The \\\"virtual camera\\\" can focus on virtually any aspect of the pitch, giving viewers an insight into action that the camera normally cannot see. Piero also provides a wealth of statistical detail - from the length of kicks, to the length of a run of an individual player and the height of a lift at any lineout. Mr Townsend said sports performance companies were already showing an interest in the technology. BBC Broadcast hopes the technology can be sold to third parties interested in using it a number of different ways - from sport broadcasting to entertainment and game shows.\",\n          \"Games 'deserve a place in class'\\n\\nComputer games could enhance learning and have a legitimate place in the classroom, say researchers.\\n\\nAcademics from the Institute of Education at London University found that \\\"games literacy\\\" was a key skill for youngsters. As well as being used in different areas of the curriculum, games are a legitimate area of study in their own right, researchers say. Pupils should also be able to create their own games, they say.\\n\\n\\\"Like all games, computer and video games entertain while promoting social development, and playing and talking about games is an important part of young people's lives,\\\" said project manager Caroline Pelletier.\\n\\n\\\"Games literacy is a way of investigating how games are means of expression and representation, just like writing or drawing,\\\" she said. The researchers conducted two studies into the impact of games on education, the first looking at how they can be used in different curriculum subjects to enhance learning. Researchers found that girls were often excluded from the male-dominated world of game playing. \\\"Without first-hand experience of how much fun a game can be, they have little motivation to play and remain disengaged from an engrossing and sociable activity,\\\" said research fellow Diane Carr.\\n\\nThe second project looked at how games can be integrated into media education and concluded that writing games should be a core part of studying them. Sixth-form teacher Barney Oram already teaches computer games alongside the more traditional study of film, TV and popular music at the A-level course he runs at Long Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge.\\n\\nFor parents, the idea that computer games could be brought into the classroom environment, could cause controversy. Dr Andrew Burn, associate director of the Institute of Education's Centre for the Study of Children, Youth and Media moved to reassure anxious parents. \\\"Games are a legitimate cultural form that deserve critical analysis in schools just as film, television and literature do,\\\" he said. \\\"But we also want to argue that full understanding only comes when children have the tools to create their own games.\\\" The games industry welcomed the report, saying it showed how games had a positive impact on children. \\\"At a time of hysterical and inaccurate reporting it is heartening to see the cultural, social and educational value of computer and video games being assessed intelligently,\\\" said Roger Bennett, director general of the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association. \\\"This report is further evidence, if it were needed, about the excellence and imagination that thrives in gaming. They have much to offer to the education of our children and they have much to offer as a career.\\\" The three-year research project, which is being presented at a seminar on Tuesday in London, was partly funded by the Department of Trade and Industry.\",\n          \"Hollywood to sue net film pirates\\n\\nThe US movie industry has launched legal action to sue people who facilitate illegal film downloading.\\n\\nThe Motion Picture Association of America wants to stop people using the program BitTorrent to swap movies. The industry is targeting people who run websites which provide information and internet links to movies which have been copied or filmed in cinemas. More than 100 server operators have been targeted in the actions launched in the US and UK, the MPAA added. The suits were filed against users of the file-sharing programs BitTorrent, eDonkey and DirectConnect in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Finland and the Netherlands, the MPAA said.\\n\\nBitTorrent users can download movies by following a link to files which are found on websites called trackers. Unlike most peer-to-peer programs BitTorrent works by sharing a file, which could be anything from a legitimate digital photo to a copied movie, among multiple users at the same time. The movie industry hopes that suing the people who run the trackers will cut BitTorrent users off from illegal movies at source. Last month major film studios started legal action against 200 individuals who were swapping films online. The growth in broadband has made it quicker for people to download movies and the industry fears that if it does not take action now, it could suffer the same downturn as the music industry.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"tech\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"preprocessed_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 342,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"seaman sail biometric future  luxury cruise liner crystal harmony currently gulf mexico setting test biometric technology  holidaymaker enjoy balmy breeze ship crew test prototype version world first internationally issue biometric id card seafarer equivalent passport owner picture name personal detail seafarers identity document incorporate barcode represent unique feature holder fingerprint card due issue february year line revise un convention seafarers identity documents june 2003 tests currently way caribbean design ensure card machine reader produce different company different country work interoperable standard result current test involve seafarer wide range occupation nationality publish international labour organisation ilo november crystal cruises operate crystal harmony explore biometric commit technology  authenticorp technology consultancy work ilo technical specification card  issue seafarer id country want sure ship land port country validate equipment instal authenticorps ceo cynthia musselman tell bbc go digital programme french jordanian nigerian national first seafarer get id card country ratify convention aim combat international terrorism whilst guarantee welfare one million seafarer estimate sea convention highlight importance access shore facility shore leave vital element sailor wellbee safe shipping clean ocean increase security sea border control protection card hopefully reduce number piracy problem world ms musselman safe environment seafarer work allow people protect border confidence people get ship fact seafarer\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 12,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 14,\n        \"samples\": [\n          10\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bertopic_topic_label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
